### Our Vision

* * *

Every IJ girl will develop their creative talents, competencies and skills, which are beneficial to their working and recreational lives. In the process of acquiring an understanding of the arts practice, they become more aware of the socialising influence of the arts and are motivated to participate and enjoy the arts as discerning practitioners and consumers.

### Our Mission

* * *

Every IJ girl will express and share the vitality of their culture and community through the construction of a personal and cultural identity and in the process of so doing, understand and appreciate the culture and identity of others in the community and the world at large.

### Our Objectives

* * *

An IJ girls is:

  

A **Thinker** who through her involvement in the artistic domains and practices that are unique to these domains think inductively, deductively and intuitively.

  

A **Communicator**, who in her involvement in both the local and global arts scene, will express herself effectively and confidently in a variety of contexts and to a wide range of audience.

  

A **Leader** who has global awareness and openness in creating new opportunities and the capacity to lead in collective endeavour.

### Our Programme

**Overview**

  

The CHIJ Arts curriculum, a dovetail of the IJ Education and Curriculum Framework which supports the COE for Languages and the Arts, is developed to provide opportunities for students to create, reflect, challenge, critique and celebrate in the artistic domains of Drama and the Visual Arts.

  

The curriculum is designed to enrich the learning experience of each and every IJ girl in the 4 or 5 years that they spend in the school.

  

**Outcomes**

  

The CHIJ Arts Curriculum, a framework for the arts pedagogy, learning activities and programmes and, assessment tasks through which allow IJ girls to:

  

*   create, present and reflect on art works with confidence, aesthetic know-how and enjoyment.  
    
*   express ideas feelings and experiences, personal or otherwise, through the processes that are unique to each of the artistic domains.  
    
*   communicate with confidence to an intended audience through the forms and processes within the artistic domains in question.  
    
*   understand and appreciate the unique contribution of each of the artistic domains as well as how the processes and techniques within these domains can work in tandem with each other.  
    

  

Each of the artistic domains has skills, techniques, technologies, and processes that are unique to the art form. The learning outcomes of the Drama and the Visual Arts are somewhat interrelated, complementary and interactive.
