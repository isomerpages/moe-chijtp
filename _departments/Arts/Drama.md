The CHIJ Drama programme was started in Jan 2006. CHIJ Secondary is one of 8 selected schools in that offers drama in the curriculum and drama as an Elective GCE O-Level Exam subject.

Benefits of learning through drama include developing interpersonal and intrapersonal skills in students which are so necessary to effective social and working lives. Students learn through this collaborative art form , to work with each other, developing skills of negotiation, teamwork and harmonious relationships as they recognise qualities individuals contribute to a shared experience. At the end of their course in drama, it is hoped that they become more self-confident as they develop language and communication skills.

Drama provides a safe place for experimentation where students learn that failure is only a part of the journey of experimentation and discovery, not the destination.
