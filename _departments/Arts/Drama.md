The CHIJ Drama programme was started in Jan 2006. CHIJ Secondary is one of 8 selected schools in that offers drama in the curriculum and drama as an Elective GCE O-Level Exam subject.

Benefits of learning through drama include developing interpersonal and intrapersonal skills in students which are so necessary to effective social and working lives. Students learn through this collaborative art form , to work with each other, developing skills of negotiation, teamwork and harmonious relationships as they recognise qualities individuals contribute to a shared experience. At the end of their course in drama, it is hoped that they become more self-confident as they develop language and communication skills.

Drama provides a safe place for experimentation where students learn that failure is only a part of the journey of experimentation and discovery, not the destination.

*   Create, present, and reflect on drama works with confidence, skill, enjoyment and aesthetic awareness  
    
*   Express ideas and feelings through the artform of drama

*   Work in a disciplined and collaborative way towards a shared goal

#### LEARNING IN DRAMA

* * *

Learning in drama requires an experiential mode of learning that involves active participation in the three domains of making, presenting and reflecting which provide the framework for learning in drama. These are considered interrelated, interdependent and equally important.

*   Making involves the active exploration of ideas through the application of the elements and conventions of drama. Students select and structure dramatic elements and conventions to create and shape dramatic action. They work in the forms of improvisation, roleplay, story-telling, and playbuilding to create original works. In this domain students learn to work with ideas, holding some and discarding others as they refine meaning, reframing and delaying final judgement, thus leading to development of the skills of flexible and creative thinking.

*   Presenting involves the development of expressive communication processes which may lead to performance. Students apply the elements and conventions of drama to a practical knowledge of dramatic forms and styles as they develop a range of performance skills. In this domain students learn to value the processes of rehearsal and refinement as they work towards a shared goal.  
    
*   Reflecting involves interpretation, critical analysis and evaluation of their own and othersâ€™ dramatic works. Students demonstrate their understanding of the application of elements and conventions to a range of dramatic forms and styles. In this domain students learn to use the vocabulary of drama to communicate in written and oral forms.
