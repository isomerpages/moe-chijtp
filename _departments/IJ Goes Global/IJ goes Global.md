Overseas partnerships prepare our students to be part of a globalized community through cross-cultural exposure. The IJ Goes Global Programme includes cultural exchanges through hosting
students from other countries as well as travelling overseas, which help our students’ global
awareness and rootedness.
As the global IJ community includes sister schools in other countries, partnership programmes
with these schools (chiefly the Yokohama, Shizuoka, Denenchofu and Fukuoka Futaba schools
in Japan) foster an inclusive IJ community and strengthen the IJ identity.
	
Overseas programmes also give teachers the opportunity to engage in professional dialogue
when students are attending lessons, as is the case with the twinning programmes with St Paul’s
Co-Educational College and Diocesan Girls’ School in Hong Kong, and with Trung Vuong
School in Vietnam. Besides enabling our students to gain insights into the cultures of the
ASEAN region, the IJ BEACON programme provides our students with the opportunity to use
their talents and skills to serve those who are disadvantaged and develop important qualities such
as empathy and resilience.
