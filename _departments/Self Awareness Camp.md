<p>A key student development experience for our graduating cohort, the annual
Self-Awareness Camp is an opportunity&nbsp;for our girls and teachers to
come together to prepare for the year ahead. A time of self-discovery,
class bonding and connecting with their teachers, this signature programme
provides our girls the time and space to learn more about their own strengths
and areas for growth as well as relate to others on a more personal level.
At the end of the programme, the deeper level of self-awareness facilitates
the forging of stronger relationships with those around them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The overnight experience for our Secondary 4 students includes personal
reflection and sharing facilitated by the form teachers and culminates
in the creation of a class vision board for the year. Our Secondary 5 students
go through a similar process, getting to know their new form&nbsp;class
through writing and reflection before setting class goals. An integral
part of the distinctive IJ experience we offer, this camp is a longstanding
tradition that equips our girls with the skills and competencies necessary
to become Women of Distinction.</p>
