<p>The Humanities curriculum seeks to develop curious learners who are critical
thinkers and responsible global citizens. These attributes are developed
by exposing students to learning through inquiry.</p>
<h4>Geography and History</h4>
<p>
<br>In Geographical and Historical Investigation, for instance, students investigate
geographical issues between human beings and the environment and study
a range of historical sources to make sense of the past.</p>
<h4>Social Studies&nbsp;</h4>
<p>
<br>In Social Studies lessons, students critically examine societal issues
such as an ageing population, discrimination and globalization. They also
conduct research to understand the impact of these issues on Singapore
and how citizens can play an active role in mitigating the problems they
bring.</p>
