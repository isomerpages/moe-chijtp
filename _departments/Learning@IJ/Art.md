<p><strong>Mission Statement</strong>
</p>
<p>To nurture inquiring and engaged art learners who display curiosity, resourcefulness,
cultural awareness and discernment, to communicate, collaborate and innovate
in the increasingly complex world</p>
<p><strong>Art</strong>
</p>
<p>Art is a compulsory subject at lower secondary levels and it aims to develop
both visual literacy and art appreciation in students. Students will embark
on an art experience which encompasses artmaking, reflections, journalling,
presentations and learning journeys.</p>
<p>Students who express keen interest, disposition and ability in Art are
encouraged to pursue Art at upper secondary levels. Students will offer
the GCE ‘O’ / ‘N(A)’ / ‘N(T)’ Level Art examination at the end of 2 years.</p>
<p><strong>Art Elective Programme (AEP)</strong>
</p>
<p>AEP is a four-year programme at the secondary level and a two-year programme
at the junior college level. As one of the first AEP schools which started
AEP in 1985, we have established a rich programme that offers students
opportunities to experience art through the 3Ls@IJ – Learning and acquisition
of skills, Living and applying what is learnt in art making, and Leading
through local and international partnership opportunities.</p>
<p>The AEP curriculum places an equal emphasis on the practical and theoretical
aspects of Art, with the aim to develop their creativity and critical thinking.
Students will be exposed to an exciting range of media and art forms, such
as ceramics, digital art, painting, photography and printmaking. We have
also established strategic partnerships to create authentic learning experiences
for our students, such as through museum visits, artist talks and our signature
Twinning Programme with schools and museums in Japan.</p>
<p>Students will offer the GCE ‘O’ Level Higher Art examination at the end
of 4 years.</p>
<p>For a glimpse of the AEP curriculum, please refer to the&nbsp;Little Book
of Art Lessons.</p>
