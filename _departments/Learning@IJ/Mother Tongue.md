<h3>Chinese Language</h3>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>The Chinese Department seeks to provide a conducive environment for students
to develop reading, writing, listening and comprehension skills and to
express communicate in their Mother Tongue. Through interactive teaching
methods, use of ICT and discussion on current affairs, students gain confidences
in communicating in Their mother Tongue, and also gain an appreciation
for the language. For example, in developing the oral presentation skills
of our students, group activities such as interviews and discussions are
used as platforms to promote interaction and communication among students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese Language teachers use the adapted Flipped Classroom approach
where students engage with the discussion topics prior to the lesson, and
students can learn at their own pace. Curriculum time is maximised as students
are able to deepen their understanding of concepts through discussions
with their peers And group activities facilitated by the teacher.</p>
<p>Mother Tongue Fortnight activities are organised annually to provide opportunities
for students to gain a deeper understanding of Chinese culture and heritage
through hands-on activities and programmes. Some examples of activities

alive and complements classroom learning with experiential learning approaches
and learning journeys.</p>

<h3>Malay Language</h3>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>The Malay Language Unit of the Mother Tongue Department at CHIJ aims to
develop the language as a Living Language - one that is used on a day to
day basis, in various environments, by students who are articulate, confident
and passionate about their mother tongue.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lessons</strong>
</p>
<p>Malay Language lessons provide the best opportunity and platform for the
students to learn and inculcate the love for the Malay Language. Leveraging
on the usage of innovative pedagogies and tools, we strive to engage our
students effectively. Also recognising the challenges faced by students
in learning the language, we aim to inculcate, to the best of our ability,
the usage of the language in an authentic learning environment. These will
ensure that our students are articulate in the language.</p>
<p><strong>Mother Tongue Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>Through the students participation in activities organised such as the
Mother Tongue Fortnight and Learning Journeys, students develop a greater
understanding of the Malay culture and norms. Activities such as the Malay
Language &amp; Cultural Quiz and theatre or drama performances viewing
also provide a platform for the students to explore deeper. These will
develop the confidence in our students in using the language.</p>
<p><strong>Competitions</strong>
</p>
<p>Throughout the school year, our students are encouraged to participate
in a myriad of Malay Language competitions and activities organised by
MOE and various organisations. Through their participation in these competitions,
students develop their passion and love for the language. With this, we
hope that our students will also learn to realise the language roles and
importance in the society, country and regional world.</p>
