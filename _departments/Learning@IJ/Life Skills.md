<p>Design and Technology is part of a holistic broad-based education. It
is a compulsory project-based subject in the lower secondary school curriculum.
Design and Technology anchors on design action and application of knowledge
and design process.</p>
<p>The lower secondary Design and Technology syllabus aims to enable pupils
to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>develop an awareness of design in the made-world;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop an appreciation of function, aesthetics and technology in design;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop basic design thinking and communication skills;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>experience the process of realising design through making and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>think creatively to become autonomous decision makers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pupils are engaged in design-and-make activities. Designs are adapted
to their abilities, interest and design context. Pupils will then make
use of wood and plastics to make the products that they have designed and
apply skills such as sawing, filing, drilling, polishing, bending and joining.</p>
<p>The syllabus for lower secondary pupils has been revised to incorporate
Interior Design with the Product Design syllabus.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<strong>Product Design</strong>, all pupils are taught the design
process and they use the design process to design and make products.</p>
<p>They are also taught theory on processes, such as sawing, filing, drilling,
surface finishing and joining.</p>
<p>Secondary 2 Express pupils are taught Isometric Drawing to enable them
to be able to sketch 3dimensional design ideas.</p>
<p>Secondary 2 Normal Academic pupils are taught Oblique Drawing to enable
them to be able to sketch 3-dimensional design ideas.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<strong>Interior Design</strong>, pupils learnt the basic theory
such as, Materials, Lighting, Colour, Furniture, Accessories used in Interior
Design.
<br>Secondary 1 pupils are taught to design rooms using Goggle Sketch-up.
<br>Secondary 2 pupils designed and made scale-down cardboard models of rooms.</p>
<p># <strong>Secondary One</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Product Design</strong>&nbsp;– Secondary 1E pupils designed and
made Wooden Torchlight Keychains</p>

<h4>Elements of Business Skills</h4>
<p>In Elements of Business Skills, students are taught to develop basic understanding
of the business activities in three main industries – travel and tourism,
hospitality and retail. They will be equipped with basic marketing concepts
and customer relations skills and explore the employability for working
in these industries. In CHIJ, students embark on a series of Learning Journeys
such as the Hippo Hop-on-hop-off tour and factory tours and workshops which
in the airline services industry to&nbsp; apply their conceptual, analytical
and evaluative skills to make sound justifiable decisions.</p>
<h4>Food &amp; Consumer Education</h4>
<p>FCE in the 21st century is designed with the social and economic landscape
of Singapore in mind, both current and future. We take into consideration
new lifestyles and consumer trends, and therefore, the knowledge, skills
and attitudes required of our students related to health and financial
management.</p>
<p>Our department aims to equip students with the knowledge about diet and
health, so that they could be more discerning in choosing nutritious food
for good health and be informed of the benefits of a balanced meal as the
girls are making more food choices while parents are busy at work. Students
will also be equipped with food management skills where they will be taught
culinary skills to be self-sufficient in planning and preparing healthy
meals for themselves and their family. At the same time, students will
also learn to be appreciative of the diversity of food from different cultures
in Singapore. The department uses the EEEA (Engage, Explore, Explain and
Apply) Inquiry Approach to provide authentic and discovery learning for
the students where they learn to demonstrate critical thinking skills in
comparing and applying prior knowledge learnt and this will enable them
to see the interconnectedness of ideas resulting in a more meaningful learning
experience.</p>
<h4>Principles of Accounts</h4>
<p>The main objective of the department is to develop the knowledge and analytical
skills of the students and to inculcate values and attitudes to enable
them to succeed as competent, ethical individuals in the practice of accounting
and make financial decision for themselves, in business, government and
non-profit making organisations.</p>
