Every year, awards are offered to students based on their character, leadership, conduct, learning dispositions and academic performance. Edusave Awards that recognise a student's character, conduct and leadership are as follows:

**Edusave Award for Achievement, Good Leadership and Service (EAGLES)**
EAGLES is awarded to students who have demonstrated leadership qualities, service to community and schools, excellence in non-academic activities, and good conduct.


**Edusave Character Award (ECHA)**
ECHA recognises the students who have demonstrated exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour and actions. 


If you would like to nominate a student for ECHA, kindly reach out to Ms Sum Kar Mun and Mr Titus Chang at [sum\_kar\_mun@moe.edu.sg](mailto:sum_kar_mun@moe.edu.sg) and [chang\_guang\_rong@moe.edu.sg](mailto:chang_guang_rong@moe.edu.sg) respectively by 29 August 2025.
