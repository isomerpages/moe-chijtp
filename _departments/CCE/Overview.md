Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is a key aspect of the distinctive IJ education we offer to our students where we believe in nurturing the potential of every girl. With the school’s Mission, Vision, Values and Motto, and MOE’s Desired Outcomes of Education, 21cc skills and SEL Competencies providing the philosophical underpinning for CCE@IJ and the realities of the VUCA world as considerations, CHIJ has customised a CCE Curriculum (CCE@IJ) to nurture and prepare our IJ girls to be Women of Distinction.

  

As such, the school has identified six Strengths of Character:

  

1\. Lifelong Learner and Critical Thinker;

  

2\. Diligent and Capable Performer;

  

3\. Socially and Emotionally Skilled Leader;

  

4\. Responsible and Self-Disciplined Person;

  

5\. Contributing Community Member;

  

6\. Spiritual Person crafting a Purposeful Life.

  

These Strengths of Character are further articulated in the CCE Competency Map which comprises 30 competencies. These CCE Competencies are infused in the IP and Co-Curricular areas and the internalisation of these competencies are discussed using the Milestone Checklist. The Milestone Checklist is used by teachers during the dialogue sessions with students to guide students in the attainment of the CCE Competencies.

  

CCE Experiences

CCE@IJ adopts the Awareness-Action-Reflection approach where students gain awareness of the CCE Competencies through CCE experiences. Students can then apply what they have learnt in subsequent experiences, including cocurricular activities, Values-in-Action projects, and Student Leadership programmes. This cycle reinforces student learning of values as well as the relevant knowledge and skills to develop themselves, build meaningful relationships with others and make responsible decisions. Reflection is also a key component of the CCE experience to enable students to process what they have gone through, evaluate their actions, and seek ways to improve themselves. 

  

Key CCE experiences include:

• CCE lessons e.g. on Cyberwellness, Mental Wellbeing

• Cohort experiences e.g. level camps 

• Education and Career Guidance

• National Education experiences

• Values in Action projects and activities 

• Student Leadership programmes
