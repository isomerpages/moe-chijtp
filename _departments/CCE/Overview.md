<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is a key aspect of the distinctive
IJ education we offer to our students where we believe in nurturing the
potential of every girl. With the school’s Mission, Vision, Values and
Motto, and MOE’s Desired Outcomes of Education, 21cc skills and SEL Competencies
providing the philosophical underpinning for CCE@IJ and the realities of
the VUCA world as considerations, CHIJ has customised a CCE Curriculum
(CCE@IJ) to nurture and prepare our IJ girls to be Women of Distinction.</p>
<p><strong>CCE Experiences</strong>
<br>CCE@IJ involves students learning through various CCE experiences, reflecting
on what they have learnt and applying this learning in subsequent experiences.
These include CCE lessons, cocurricular activities, Values in Action projects,
and Student Leadership programmes.</p>
<p>This cycle reinforces student learning of values as well as the relevant
knowledge and skills to develop themselves, build meaningful relationships
with others and make responsible decisions. Reflection is also a key component
of the CCE experience to enable students to process what they have gone
through, evaluate their actions, and seek ways to improve themselves.&nbsp;</p>
