VALUES IN ACTION (VIA) at CHIJ Secondary aims to create awareness of social and environmental issues and inspire our students to take initiative to make a positive influence to the community. Values-centric programmes provide our students with opportunities to espouse the school values of compassion, humility, integrity, perseverance and faith, and to apply the knowledge and skills learnt through the formal and non-formal curriculum to their outreach. At the end of each programme, students undertake a systematic reflection which inculcates in them the habit of looking inwards, so that their bedrock of values and skills will continue to manifest itself outwardly.
