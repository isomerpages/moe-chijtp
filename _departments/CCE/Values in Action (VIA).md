<p>Values in Action (VIA) at CHIJ Secondary adopts a tiered approach that
empowers students to become active, responsible citizens through hands-on
experiences. These experiences are designed to enable students to contribute
meaningfully to the broader community, while aligning with their developmental
needs and capabilities at each stage. The VIA programme also fosters studentsâ€™
autonomy by encouraging them to make informed choices about the causes
they wish to support. This process not only deepens their understanding
of societal and environmental needs but also encourages them to apply their
values, knowledge, and skills in real-world contexts. Through these meaningful
engagements, we aim to nurture every IJ girl to think critically and empathetically,
recognising the importance of addressing the needs of others while continuing
to grow as responsible individuals.</p>
