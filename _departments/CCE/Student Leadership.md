**Developing Women of Distinction**

The CHIJ Student Leadership programme aims to contribute to the development of our students as Thinkers, Leaders and Communicators – servant leaders who play a part to uplift their communities.&nbsp;

  

Our approach to student leadership is guided by the IJ mission to create a Christ-centred school community where all work together for the promotion of truth, justice, freedom, and love, with special reference to the needs of persons who are disadvantaged in any way. We believe that every IJ girl is therefore a leader of self and a leader for others; she exemplifies the school motto in how she carries herself and how she contributes to the betterment of the community she belongs to.

  

**Our programme**

Guided by our school mission, motto and values, our students engage in meaningful learning experiences while supported by teacher mentors who nurture their passion to serve.&nbsp;

  

In their 4–5 years with us, students go through a structured leadership programme and develop key competencies through a range of activities such as lesson discussions, workshops and hands-on experiences. All CHIJ students are given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the Five Practices in Kouzes and Posner’s ‘The Leadership Challenge’ and are empowered to participate actively in level-appropriate milestone experiences that serve as platforms for them to apply and reinforce their learning.&nbsp;
