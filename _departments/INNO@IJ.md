<p>The INNO@IJ experience provides students with various platforms to explore
their interests, express their creativity, and cultivate an entrepreneurial
spirit. From robotics to game design, we offer a range of diverse activities
to spark students’ interests and deepen their passion. Through our maker
activities, students are given opportunities to tinker and create with
a range of maker tools, both analogue and digital, to solve problems and
actualize their creative solutions to design challenges.</p>

<p>We believe that through trial and error, our students can nurture and
deepen their 21st-century competencies. Through our Talent Development
Programme, students are exposed to content beyond the formal curriculum
and extend the Joy of Learning beyond the classroom. We hope to empower
our students to be innovative thinkers, lifelong learners, and active contributors
to their communities.</p>
