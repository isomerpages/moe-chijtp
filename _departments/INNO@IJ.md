<p>The INNO@IJ experience provides students with various platforms to explore
their interests, express their creativity, and cultivate an entrepreneurial
spirit. From robotics to game design, we offer a range of diverse activities
to spark studentsâ€™ interests and deepen their passion. Through our maker
activities, students are given opportunities to tinker and create with
a range of maker tools, both analogue and digital, to solve problems and
actualize their creative solutions to design challenges. We believe that
through trial and error, our students can nurture and deepen their 21st-century
competencies. Through our Talent Development Programme, students are exposed
to content beyond the formal curriculum and extend the Joy of Learning
beyond the classroom. We hope to empower our students to be innovative
thinkers, lifelong learners, and active contributors to their communities.</p>
