<p>Anchored by the English Language and Literature department, the annual
IJ Flair Festival presents a vibrant tapestry of language and the arts.
This celebration underscores our commitment to nurturing students as confident,
empathetic, and eloquent communicators.</p>
<p>In IJ FLAIR, students immerse themselves in drama, music, and visual art
to hone their skills and express themselves with flair. Through various
engaging activities, participants delight in showcasing their creativity,
acquiring new knowledge, and demonstrating proficiency in different skills.</p>
<p>The festival boasts a lineup of engaging events, including an Art exhibition
featuring our talented graduating AEP students, the captivating CAPIJ e-anthology
showcasing the literary works of student writers, and a delightful poetry
recital with enchanting musical performances. Students can also look forward
to the evocative Reader's Theatre performances by lower secondary students,
the soul-stirring songwriting competition, and enchanting ukulele performances
that enrich the cultural tapestry of IJ FLAIR. Adding to the excitement
is a fun Pyjama Party event where students can enjoy a movie screening
and participate in open-mic performances by their schoolmates. Moreover,
a thought-provoking TEDtalk @IJ delivered by upper secondary students and
a range of intellectually stimulating activities are designed to ignite
a passion for language and the arts within the hearts and minds of our
students.</p>
<p>IJ FLAIR stands as a testament to our unwavering dedication to fostering
a dynamic and enriching learning environment for all students involved
in these transformative experiences.</p>
