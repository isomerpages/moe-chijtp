<p>Students are at the centre of the Music Programme in CHIJ Secondary. We
believe that all students have the ability to respond to and express themselves
through music. We therefore aim to not only develop studentsâ€™ musical skills
and concepts, but also inculcate important values that will enrich and
empower them to grow holistically in their educational journey at CHIJ
Secondary.</p>
