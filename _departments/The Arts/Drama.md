<p>The CHIJ Drama programme was started in Jan 2006. CHIJ Secondary is one
of 8 selected schools in that offers drama in the curriculum and drama
as an Elective GCE O-Level Exam subject.</p>
<p>Benefits of learning through drama include developing interpersonal and
intrapersonal skills in students which are so necessary to effective social
and working lives. Students learn through this collaborative art form ,
to work with each other, developing skills of negotiation, teamwork and
harmonious relationships as they recognise qualities individuals contribute
to a shared experience. At the end of their course in drama, it is hoped
that they become more self-confident as they develop language and communication
skills.</p>
<p>Drama provides a safe place for experimentation where students learn that
failure is only a part of the journey of experimentation and discovery,
not the destination.</p>

<h4>LEARNING IN DRAMA</h4>
<hr>
<p>Learning in drama requires an experiential mode of learning that involves
active participation in the three domains of making, presenting and reflecting
which provide the framework for learning in drama. These are considered
interrelated, interdependent and equally important.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Making involves the active exploration of ideas through the application
of the elements and conventions of drama. Students select and structure
dramatic elements and conventions to create and shape dramatic action.
They work in the forms of improvisation, roleplay, story-telling, and playbuilding
to create original works. In this domain students learn to work with ideas,
holding some and discarding others as they refine meaning, reframing and
delaying final judgement, thus leading to development of the skills of
flexible and creative thinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Presenting involves the development of expressive communication processes
which may lead to performance. Students apply the elements and conventions
of drama to a practical knowledge of dramatic forms and styles as they
develop a range of performance skills. In this domain students learn to
value the processes of rehearsal and refinement as they work towards a
shared goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflecting involves interpretation, critical analysis and evaluation of
their own and othersâ€™ dramatic works. Students demonstrate their understanding
of the application of elements and conventions to a range of dramatic forms
and styles. In this domain students learn to use the vocabulary of drama
to communicate in written and oral forms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>ASSESSMENT IN DRAMA</h4>
<hr>
<p>Objectives of assessment will incorporate the following:</p>
<p><strong>Understanding</strong>
</p>
<p>Students should be able to demonstrate understanding of the performance
possibilities of text and other stimuli and the differing roles of actor,
director, stage manager and technician in their realisation.</p>
<p><strong>Devising</strong>
</p>
<p>Students should be able to demonstrate the ability to devise dramatic
material and reflect on its effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Performing Skills</strong>
</p>
<p>Students should be able to demonstrate performing skills in drama The
above is based on the assessment requirement as stipulated in the IGCSE
Examination. However, at lower secondary levels, expectations will be adjusted
to suit the capabilities and objectives of the respective levels. However,
the IGCSE assessment objectives should be adhered to in when students commence
their 2 year IGCSE Drama course in Secondary 3.</p>
