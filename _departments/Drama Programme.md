<p>The lower secondary&nbsp;Drama&nbsp;programme aims to deepen studentsâ€™
understanding of cultural and social constructs via activity-based collaborative
learning. Every lesson is therefore an opportunity for students to hone
their communication skills and think critically about the issue or task
at hand. At the end of each weekly lesson, they showcase their learning
through a short performance, drawing on their personal experiences, observations,
and interpretation of the stimulus provided.</p>

<br>The foundations of performance-making and theatre are laid here in lower
secondary.</p>
