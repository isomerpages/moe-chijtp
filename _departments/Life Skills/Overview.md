<p><strong>Vision Statement</strong>
</p>
<p>The Lifeskills&nbsp; Department aims to inculcate knowledge and skills
to every student, providing them with the opportunity to make informed
choices which will develop them into a Woman of Distinction.</p>
<h4>Design &amp; Technology</h4>
<p>Design and Technology is part of a holistic broad-based education. It
is a compulsory project-based subject in the lower secondary school curriculum.
Design and Technology anchors on design action and application of knowledge
and design process.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The lower secondary Design and Technology syllabus aims to enable pupils
to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>develop an awareness of design in the made-world;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop an appreciation of function, aesthetics and technology in design;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop basic design thinking and communication skills;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>experience the process of realising design through making and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>think creatively to become autonomous decision makers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pupils are engaged in design-and-make activities. Designs are adapted
to their abilities, interest and design context. Pupils will then make
use of wood and plastics to make the products that they have designed and
apply skills such as sawing, filing, drilling, polishing, bending and joining.</p>
<p>The syllabus for lower secondary pupils has been revised to incorporate
Interior Design with the Product Design syllabus.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<strong>Product Design</strong>, all pupils are taught the design
process and they use the design process to design and make products.</p>
<p>They are also taught theory on processes, such as sawing, filing, drilling,
surface finishing and joining.</p>
<p>Secondary 2 Express pupils are taught Isometric Drawing to enable them
to be able to sketch 3-dimensional design ideas.</p>
<p>Secondary 2 Normal Academic pupils are taught Oblique Drawing to enable
them to be able to sketch 3-dimensional design ideas.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<strong>Interior Design</strong>, pupils learnt the basic theory
such as, Materials, Lighting, Colour, Furniture, Accessories used in Interior
Design.</p>
<p>Secondary 1 pupils are taught to design rooms using Goggle Sketch-up.</p>
<p>Secondary 2 pupils designed and made scale-down cardboard models of rooms.</p>
