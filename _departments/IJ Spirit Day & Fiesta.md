<p>IJ Spirit Day and Fiesta is an annual event that celebrates and promotes
the IJ Spirit with&nbsp;the students and all the alumni who have passed
through our gates. The IJ Spirit is an intangible sense of&nbsp;belonging
that is felt by all who have experienced the&nbsp;IJ education;&nbsp;it
comprises the sisterhood, laughter and camaraderie that all IJ girls experience
in&nbsp;their&nbsp;time in this school, and continues to live on in them
when they leave.</p>
<p>
<br>IJ Spirit Day celebrates this with a concert&nbsp;that consists of skits
and performances, showcasing the talents of our&nbsp;students. Organised
by the House Captains and their committees, the concert concludes with&nbsp;the
boisterous singing of IJ songs that are dear to us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IJ Fiesta, organised by the Student Council and class committees, is a
whole-school effort led by the Student Council Executive Committee. It&nbsp;continues
the emotional exhilaration with an in-house carnival filled with a variety
of scrumptious&nbsp;food and a multitude of games for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>
<br>It is our hope that this yearly festivity keeps the IJ Spirit burning
bright, as it serves to bring IJ&nbsp;girls, past, present, and future,
together in a key milestone experience that ties all the generations together
with&nbsp;laughter and joy.</p>
