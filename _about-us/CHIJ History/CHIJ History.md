<center>"The darkness of this night, wherein <br>
one sees nothing, yet sees everything, <br>
knows nothing, yet knows everything,<br>
is far better than light"</center>
	
<center><strong>- Blessed Nicolas Barré</strong></center>
	
Born in Amiens, France, in 1621 and educated at a Jesuit college in his hometown, Nicolas Barré decided at the age of 19 to dedicate his life to God, and joined the religious order of the Minims founded by St Francis of Paola. Seeing the disparity in opportunities for education between the rich and the poor in French society, he was inspired to establish an order whose specific objective was to educate girls of poor families.  
  
In 1662, Fr Barré set up a girls’ school in the village of Sotteville near Rouen, with the aid of some pious women. Over the next four years, several more schools were set up in and around Rouen.  
  
In 1666, Fr Barré realized the need for a spiritual bond among the sisters to counteract rising opposition from the other ‘writing masters’ or teachers of that time. He began a new religious congregation – the Charitable Mistresses of the Schools of the Holy Infant Jesus. As membership increased, the schools – known variously as the Charitable Christian Schools of the Holy Infant Jesus, the Little Charitable Schools or the Schools of Providence – multiplied. In Paris, he named his schools simply the Schools of the Holy Infant Jesus. In 1678, he founded a novitiate for the sisters on the Seine. However, in May 1686, his health declined, and he died on 31 May.  
  
On 7 March 1999, Nicolas Barré was beatified in Rome by Pope John Paul II at a ceremony that was the apex of three days spent in prayerful rejoicing.
