<p>As the oldest Catholic girls’ school in Singapore and the mother school
of all CHIJ schools in the nation, CHIJ Secondary has a rich and enduring
legacy. Established originally along Victoria Street — where CHIJMES now
stands — the school moved to its present Toa Payoh site in 1983. Affectionately
known then as “Town Convent,” the school was where the Sisters of the Infant
Jesus lived out their mission to provide an education for girls from all
walks of life, with a particular commitment to those in need.</p>
<p>Across more than 170 years of history and transformation, generations
of IJ girls have walked through our halls, carrying with them an education
rooted in the Christian belief in the worth and dignity of every person.
The IJ Sisters, by their example, instilled values of simplicity, faith,
and love for community — values that continue to shape our school today.</p>
<p>Our legacy lives on not just in our current students, but in the enduring
bonds of the IJ sisterhood. Many of our alumnae remain deeply connected
to the school, cherishing the memories from their time here, while warmly
welcoming younger IJ girls into the fold. Our parents are valued partners
in this journey, with the Parent Support Group continuing to serve with
dedication, offering their time, care, and support in countless ways. The
IJ Board remains a pillar of wisdom and guidance for our journey forward.</p>
<p>CHIJ Secondary is a deeply cherished school, and it is both my privilege
and joy to lead this community.</p>
<p>As an educator, I believe that the educational experience is just as vital
as educational outcomes. As John Dewey once said, “Education is life.”
Beyond acquiring knowledge and skills, true education involves developing
new attitudes and deeper engagement with life’s experiences.</p>
<p>Regardless of their background or profile, every IJ girl carries within
her immense potential. Each one has the capacity to make a positive difference
— both as an individual and as part of a greater whole.</p>
<p>At IJ Secondary, we are committed to nurturing moral clarity and courage,
encouraging our girls to develop their own convictions so they can make
informed, responsible, and community-minded choices. We believe that the
pursuit of intellectual excellence must go hand in hand with the growth
of character and compassion.</p>
<p>As our school motto reminds us, our hope for every IJ girl is that she
be</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To all our IJ girls — know that you are part of a Christ-centred community
that cares deeply for you and is committed to nurturing your growth. And
if you are not yet part of the IJ family, we warmly invite you to join
this legacy — one built on faith, love, and a deep belief in the potential
of every girl.</p>
<br>Blessings,
