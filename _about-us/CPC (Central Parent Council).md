### Join us as a Parent Volunteer!

### YOU CAN PLAY A PART

Each of us, as a parent, has a shared interest and responsibilities to our  
children. The objective of the Central Parent Council (CPC) is to create these  
partnerships between IJ parents, the school, to help all children in CHIJ  
Primary to succeed in school and in life.

Walk with us, and join in the IJ family of Parent Volunteers (PVs), who work  
together, pooling our individual skills and talents, motivated by a common  
love, not just for our daughters, but for every child in our school.

“Do not walk in front of me, <br>
I may not follow. <br>
Don’t walk behind me, <br>
I may not lead. <br>
Walk beside me <br>
And just be my friend.”<br>
(Albert Camus)
