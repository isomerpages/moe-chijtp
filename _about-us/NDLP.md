# National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)
![](/images/p1png.png)

At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy.   

  

The Covid-19 pandemic has revealed the need for us to accelerate the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP). All secondary schools will thus embark on the Personalized Digital Learning Programme (PDLP).

  

**PDLP Outcomes @ CHIJ**  

  

With every student owing a PLD, teachers can leverage the affordances of ICT tools to create ICT-enriched learning experiences. 

Through the PDLP, CHIJ aims to develop students into 

i) Critical Thinkers

ii) Leaders of Self and Others

iii) Effective Communicators.

Throughout their educational journey in IJ, students will be able to acquire digital skills across the 3 domains as shown below.

**Personal Learning Device @CHIJ**  

Having heard the views of staff, parents, and students through various engagement sessions, the school has decided to adopt the iPad as the personal learning device for our students. Every iPad will come bundled with a Pencil to maximize its use as a learning tool. The devices will be distributed to students in Term 3, and we will progressively roll out their use during lessons.

  

With hardware and software in the hand of students, the work they need to do become the work they love to do. Students love iPad because it’s portable, capable, and easy to use. It helps them to become self-directed and collaborative learners with a Multi-Touch experience that’s interactive and engaging.

**Use of Edusave**

If your child/ward is a Singapore citizen, you can use your child’s/ward’s Edusave to pay partly or fully for the PLD. A Singapore citizen student can use up to the available Edusave balance in his/her Edusave account to pay for the PLD after setting aside provision for payment of 2nd tier miscellaneous fees. MOE has provided a one-off $200 Edusave top-up, to all eligible Singaporean students in primary and secondary schools. This is on top of the annual Edusave contribution for secondary students and primary students. Parents/guardians can also choose to pay cash for the PLD. Please note that it is compulsory for all existing students on the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme to use their Edusave to pay for the PLD, after subsidies have been granted.

**Financial Assistance**

Subsidies are available to students who require financial assistance. 

Students who are under the following schemes would automatically qualify for subsidies and do not need to take any action:        

*   Singapore Citizens who are already on MOE FAS or 
*   Singapore Citizens who are already on our school-based FAS Scheme (IJ Bursary) and whose Gross Household Income (GHI) is $4,000 or less, or Per Capita Income (PCI) is $1,000 or less.   

Students who are currently not under the above schemes may approach the school’s General Office or download the Application for Subsidy **[Form](/files/Annex%20D.pdf)** to apply for an additional subsidy if their Gross Household Income (GHI) is $4,000 or less, or Per Capita Income (PCI) is $1,000 or less. “PCI” refers to the Gross Household Income divided by the total number of family members in the household. 

Application for subsidy should be submitted to the General Office.
