<p>5 January 2026</p>
<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p>
<p>Happy New Year! A warm welcome to our new Secondary 1 students and their
families. We are delighted to begin another school year together as part
of the IJ Secondary community.</p>
<p>The IJ Secondary Parents’ Support Group (PSG) is a team of parents who
work closely with the school to foster a warm, nurturing, and supportive
environment for our daughters as they grow into ladies and leaders of the
future, guided by the school’s motto:</p>
<p><strong>Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty.</strong>
</p>
<p>We partner actively with the school to support a wide range of activities
that strengthen relationships among the school, students, and parents.</p>
<p>The PSG is deeply grateful to our dedicated members whose commitment,
generosity, and enthusiasm make the planning and organisation of events
both meaningful and rewarding.</p>
<p>We are equally thankful to the many parents who have supported our events
as Parent Volunteers, generously giving their time and energy, as well
as those who have contributed in other ways.</p>
<p>As a Catholic school community, we also sincerely appreciate parents who
continually uphold the school and our girls in prayer.</p>
<p>In the year ahead, the PSG will continue to support activities for our
girls, including theValentine’s Day Fair, Easter Monday Egg Hunt, Bake
Sale, and the much-loved annual highlight — IJ Fiesta 2026 — among others.</p>
<p>As we begin the new school year, we warmly invite parents who are able
and willing to journey with us to come on board as Parent Volunteers (PVs).</p>
<p>Parents who are interested in taking a more involved role are also most
welcome to indicate their interest in joining the PSG Executive Committee
(Exco). We look forward to embracing new members and fresh perspectives
as we serve the school together.</p>
<p>Please scan the <strong><em>QR code</em></strong> below to register your
interest as a Parent Volunteer or to express interest in joining the PSG
Exco.</p>
