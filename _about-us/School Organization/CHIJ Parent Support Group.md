<p>3 rd January 2025</p>
<p>Dear Parents/ Guardians,</p>
<p>Happy New Year!&nbsp; A warm welcome to our new Secondary 1 students and
parents!</p>
<p>IJ Secondary’s PSG is a team of parents working together with the school
to create a warm and nurturing environment for our daughters as they journey
towards being ladies and leaders of the future, while following the school’s
motto of being</p>
<p><strong>Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty.</strong>
</p>
<p>We work very closely with the school to support a myriad of their activities
that strive to build enriching relationships between the school, students
and parents. The PSG is grateful to have their members whose commitment,
generosity and enthusiasm have made organising events an enjoyable and
rewarding experience.</p>
<p>Likewise, we are also grateful for the support of parents who have helped
out in different events as Parent Volunteers, giving of their invaluable
time and energy, or have given generously to support the different events.
And being in a Catholic school and environment, we deeply appreciate the
parents who regularly uphold the school and our girls in prayers.</p>
<p>We will continue to support activities for the girls this school year
– including the Valentine’s Day Fair, Easter Monday Egg Hunt, Bake Sale,
and the yearly favourite – the IJ Fiesta 2025 – just to name a few!&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we are excited about working with parents of our IJ girls. Should
you have any further queries on how to be a part of it, please do not hesitate
to email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:psg.chijsec@gmail.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">psg.chijsec@gmail.com</a> On behalf
of the PSG Exco and IJ Secondary, we thank you in advance for your support
and gift of love.</p>
<p>We looking forward to working with you in serving the school.</p>
<p>God’s blessing always,</p>
<p>Angelia</p>
<p>Chairperson PSG, CHIJ Secondary&nbsp;</p>
