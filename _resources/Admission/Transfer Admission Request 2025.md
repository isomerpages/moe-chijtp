<p>Returning Singaporean girls who would like to join us at Secondary 2 at
the beginning of the</p>
<p>next academic year are to register for the MOE&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/returning-singaporeans" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">School Placement Exercise for Returning Singaporeans (SPERS)</a>.</p>
<p>SPERS-Sec is a centralised posting exercise conducted at the end of the
year, usually sometime in October, for Returning Singaporeans who wish
to join secondary schools at Sec 2 at the beginning of the next academic
year. Based on the applicant’s SPERS results, the applicant will be given
a list of schools that she will be eligible for. The applicant will get
to indicate her 6 school choices from the eligible list, and then MOE will
post the applicant into a secondary school based on merit, vis-a-vis her
school choices and available vacancies.</p>
<p>The advantage of registering for the MOE SPERS-Sec is that the results
could be used to gain admission into the best available secondary school
in order of merit that have a vacancy without the need for further testing
by the school.</p>
