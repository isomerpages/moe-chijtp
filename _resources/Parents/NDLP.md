<h4><strong>Personal Learning Device @CHIJ</strong></h4>
<p>Having heard the views of staff, parents, and students through various
engagement sessions, the school has decided to adopt the iPad as the personal
learning device for our students. Every iPad will come bundled with a Pencil
to maximize its use as a learning tool. The devices will be distributed
to students in Term 1, and we will progressively roll out their use during
lessons.</p>
<p>With hardware and software in the hand of students, the work they need
to do become the work they love to do. Students love iPad because it’s
portable, capable, and easy to use. It helps them to become self-directed
and collaborative learners with a Multi-Touch experience that’s interactive
and engaging.&nbsp;</p>
