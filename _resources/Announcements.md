# Covid 19 Vaccination
**Parents Gateway Announcement dated 15 June 2021**

Title: Facilitated Block Booking for COVID-19 Vaccination for S1 to 5 Students

Recipients: S1, S2, S3, S4 & S5

Dear Parents/Guardians,

MOE will be block booking slots for COVID-19 vaccination for eligible secondary school students in Term 3. The school will bus these students to an MOE Vaccination Centre (VC) between 6-9 July for the 1st dose, followed by the 2nd dose sometime in August. This will only be for those who have not yet booked appointments via the National Appointment System (NAS). Those with NAS bookings should honour their appointments and will not be eligible for the facilitated vaccination.

The school will update you on the date and time for the two doses by 30 Jun once arrangements have been finalised. As far as possible, the vaccination will be scheduled to avoid clashes with national or school examinations. However, vaccination may take place during curriculum time. Parents would not be required to accompany their child on vaccination day. Please consult your child/ward’s doctor if he/she has underlying medical conditions that might affect their medical eligibility.  

If you would like school to facilitate your child/ward’s vaccination, please submit the FormSG in the link provided by 23 Jun. For parents who are overseas, a letter of authorisation and a signed hardcopy medical declaration (to be provided to the school and your child/ward) should be issued to a Singapore Citizen/Permanent Resident (e.g. family member) to register via FormSG on your behalf. Parents remain responsible for filling in the consent and medical declaration forms. If you need assistance to complete the FormSG, please approach your child’s school. 

Your child/ward will need to answer some screening questions (see attachment) at the VC. Do explain to your child regarding the information required at the VC. Please be contactable during the time of your child’s vaccination should there be a need for the staff to verify any of the information.

Students are reminded to bring their student pass for the purpose of identification at the VC. Thank you.
