# Covid 19 Vaccination
**Parents Gateway Announcement dated 15 June 2021**

Title: Facilitated Block Booking for COVID-19 Vaccination for S1 to 5 Students

Recipients: S1, S2, S3, S4 & S5

Dear Parents/Guardians,

MOE will be block booking slots for COVID-19 vaccination for eligible secondary school students in Term 3. The school will bus these students to an MOE Vaccination Centre (VC) between 6-9 July for the 1st dose, followed by the 2nd dose sometime in August. This will only be for those who have not yet booked appointments via the National Appointment System (NAS). Those with NAS bookings should honour their appointments and will not be eligible for the facilitated vaccination.

The school will update you on the date and time for the two doses by 30 Jun once arrangements have been finalised. As far as possible, the vaccination will be scheduled to avoid clashes with national or school examinations. However, vaccination may take place during curriculum time. Parents would not be required to accompany their child on vaccination day. Please consult your child/ward’s doctor if he/she has underlying medical conditions that might affect their medical eligibility.  

If you would like school to facilitate your child/ward’s vaccination, please submit the FormSG in the link provided by 23 Jun. For parents who are overseas, a letter of authorisation and a signed hardcopy medical declaration (to be provided to the school and your child/ward) should be issued to a Singapore Citizen/Permanent Resident (e.g. family member) to register via FormSG on your behalf. Parents remain responsible for filling in the consent and medical declaration forms. If you need assistance to complete the FormSG, please approach your child’s school. 

Your child/ward will need to answer some screening questions (see attachment) at the VC. Do explain to your child regarding the information required at the VC. Please be contactable during the time of your child’s vaccination should there be a need for the staff to verify any of the information.

Students are reminded to bring their student pass for the purpose of identification at the VC. Thank you.

Title: Assistance for Vaccination Appointments for Graduating Cohorts

Recipients: SECONDARY 4, SECONDARY 5, PRE-U 2, PRE-U 3

Dear Parents/Guardians,

You would have received the SMS with the unique booking link for your child/ward’s COVID-19 vaccination appointments. The majority of the graduating cohorts (N/O/A level and equivalent) who were invited had already booked their appointments for their COVID-19 vaccinations, with many of them receiving their first dose as early as 3 June 2021. If you have not done so, please log in with your child’s NRIC, and book soon in order to secure appointments on your preferred dates before the slots are open to other groups. Please note that this link is unique to your child and you are advised to book within 14 days as slots are limited.

If for some reason you have not received the SMS invitation, please check if it was sent to your spouse. If both parents did not receive the SMS, please complete the FormSG, so that we can arrange for the SMS invite to be sent to you.

  

For parents without local handphone number, a letter of authorisation and a signed hard copy medical declaration can be issued to a SC/PR (e.g. family member) who can make the registration and complete the medical declaration on your behalf. The authorised individuals will then complete the FormSG to submit their contact number. The student should bring along a copy of the signed authorisation and declaration forms on the day of the vaccination.

  

We would also like to inform you that when your child arrives at the vaccination centre, there will be a detailed set of screening questions to be answered by your child as part of the screening process. We are enclosing a copy of this form for your reference, and also for you to explain to your child regarding the information required at the vaccination centre. Also, please try to be contactable on your handphone during the expected appointment time of your child at the vaccination centre, should there be a need for the vaccination centre staff to call you to verify any of the information.

Thank you. Together we can overcome this. Stay safe!
