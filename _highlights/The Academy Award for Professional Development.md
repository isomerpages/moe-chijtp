<p>“Receiving the <strong>Academy of Singapore Teachers’ Academy Award for Innovator</strong> has
been both a humbling and rewarding experience. I have utilized <strong>Mail Merge</strong> to
design and deliver personalized feedback to my <strong>Principles of Accounts (POA)</strong> students.
By tailoring feedback to each student’s unique learning journey, I was
able to make the learning process more meaningful and impactful, enhancing
their engagement and understanding of the subject.</p>
<p>What made this journey even more special was the chance to share my approach
with fellow POA educators in the fraternity. By demonstrating the use of <strong>Mail Merge</strong> and
its potential to elevate teaching practices, I was able to contribute to
fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous learning.</p>
<p>This experience has been truly enriching and memorable, as it allowed
me to build stronger connections within the teaching community. I am deeply
grateful for this opportunity to innovate and grow alongside other passionate
and dedicated educators.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>- <strong>Mr Teo Wen Jie</strong>
