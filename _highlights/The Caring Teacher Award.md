<p>“It is with thankful hearts that we receive this award as we continue
to nurture our students into confident, independent and resilient citizens
who will contribute wholeheartedly to the growth of our nation. We celebrate
the wonderful connections we have made with our students and their parents
for they have enhanced the purpose of our profession and roles in school.
The saying 'no one is here by chance' is apt in supporting the mission
that we hold dear to our hearts as we carry on the good work of our predecessors
who worked together to promote our enduring IJ values.”</p>
