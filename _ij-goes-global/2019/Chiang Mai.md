**Day 1** 

  

Today we embarked on our trip to Chiang Mai. We arrived and went to the supermarket to buy necessities for some needy families. We were given a budget and we had to choose some items that these families would require and purchase it. It was a meaningful experience because we got to learn how to spend money according to a budget. It was also an eye opening experience when I discussed with my groupmates on what were the necessities that the families would need. We realised that what was considered daily necessities to us in Singapore could be considered a luxury here. After the supermarket, we went to have dinner, with a wide spread of yummy thai food. We stayed at a village homestay and got to experience what a village life was like. -Jamie Cheong-

  

I felt quite worried initially as i was not sure if i would do a good job in the trip. However, I feel that I should do my best and give it my all as this is a good learning opportunity for me. After we arrived in Chiang Mai, we went to the supermarket to purchase basic necessities for some families in need, with a given budget. The most meaningful part of this experience was that we had to choose what they needed rather than what would be luxury items that they would not use as much. From this, i have learnt to prioritise what is important. After a scrumptious dinner, we proceeded to the homestay village. The Villagehead and his family were very welcoming and kind to us. Even though we arrived quite late in the night, they still waited to greet us.  -Joann Lim-
