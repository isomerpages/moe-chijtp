<p>The National Stadium was a sea of blue on 20 May as an estimated 20,000
of us – students, staff, alumni, parents and friends of all 11 IJ schools
– came together to celebrate 170 years of CHIJ in Singapore.</p>
<p>The highlight before Mass was the launch of our song album, 'Hold On To
Our IJ Dream', on Apple Music and Spotify.</p>

<p>In his homily at Mass, William Cardinal Goh,&nbsp;noting that it was the
feast of Mary, Mother of the Church, said that Mary was filled with the
virtues that IJ aspires to: humility, justice, compassion, simplicity,
love for the poor.&nbsp;In order to fulfil our IJ Dream and our motto of
being Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty, there is no-one better than
Mary who can inspire us.</p>

<p>Finally, international jazz artiste and our alumna Alemay Fernandez&nbsp;led
us in the new version of Hold On To Our Dream – it was truly heart-warming
to have 20,000 voices singing together!</p>
<p>It was truly a beautiful, wonderful celebration of our IJ Spirit. We thank
God for his blessings over our school these past 170 years, and pray that
he will continue to lead, guide and inspire us for a long time to come!</p>
