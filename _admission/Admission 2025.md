CHIJ Secondary welcomes Secondary 1 SC/SPR students who are studying in an MOE secondary school to apply for admission to CHIJ Secondary for Secondary 2 in 2025.  

  

How do I apply?

  
Application is to be done strictly via this link – [Transfer/Admission Request](https://form.gov.sg/66f9f78833ca7980256e7677)

  
Applicants should have obtained a very good conduct grade for Secondary 1. Only shortlisted applicants will be notified via email or phone call by 1 Nov 2024. The application is deemed to be unsuccessful if you do not hear from the school by 1 Nov 2024. 

  

Shortlisted applicants will be invited for an interview with school personnel at CHIJ Secondary between 8 Oct – 8 Nov 2024. 

  

We do not accept any transfer of students into Secondary 3 as we do not have any vacancy.

*   Returning Singaporeans
    

Returning Singaporean girls who would like to join us at Secondary 2 at the beginning of the next academic year are to register for the MOE [School Placement Exercise for Returning Singaporeans (SPERS)](https://www.moe.gov.sg/returning-singaporeans).

SPERS-Sec is a centralised posting exercise conducted at the end of the year, usually sometime in October, for Returning Singaporeans who wish to join secondary schools at Sec 2 at the beginning of the next academic year. Based on the applicant’s SPERS results, the applicant will be given a list of schools that she will be eligible for. The applicant will get to indicate her 6 school choices from the eligible list, and then MOE will post the applicant into a secondary school based on merit, vis-a-vis her school choices and available vacancies.

The advantage of registering for the MOE SPERS-Sec is that the results could be used to gain admission into the best available secondary school in order of merit that has a vacancy without the need for further testing by the school.

Visit the MOE website at [https://www.moe.gov.sg/returning-singaporeans](https://www.moe.gov.sg/returning-singaporeans) for more information.
