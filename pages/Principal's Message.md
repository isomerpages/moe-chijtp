<p>Since 1854, CHIJ Secondary has been true to its mission to provide education to young women within a Christ-centred community.&nbsp; Being the oldest Catholic girls’ school in Singapore, we have nurtured generations of IJ girls who have benefitted from being in a community that places learning, faith and service at the heart of all we do.</p>

<p>As a Catholic school, we believe that each of us is created in the image and likeness of God, and it is this inner spirituality that guides us in discovering our unique selves, each with our own gifts and talents that we can use in the service of others.  We want to provide each girl that comes through our gates with opportunities to discover who they are, and empower them to find their voice, think critically and lead with integrity so that they can be beacons of hope and light for the future.  We want to form them to be women of distinction, imbued  with a sense of truth, justice, freedom and love, and guided by our motto, “Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty.”</p>

<p>We cannot do this alone and are blessed to have the support of the IJ Sisters, IJ Board of Management, Catholic archdiocese, parents, and alumni.  Together in partnership, we can do so much more and provide more diverse opportunities for our girls to pursue academic excellence, develop strength of character and a heart for others.</p>

<p>Beyond these opportunities, the relationships formed in CHIJ Secondary are perhaps what are most precious. There is an instant connection when one says that “I am an IJ girl”; and it is these connections that continue to shape and support us long after graduation.</p>

<p>I have benefitted from being formed and shaped by this wonderful community. As an IJ girl, returning as Principal to the school where I had spent 10 years of my educational journey is one of the greatest blessings I have received.  I have experienced first-hand the many opportunities to learn and grow in all aspects of personal development.  These experiences instilled in me the Christ-centred values, commitment to mission and service, and sense of community that guide my leadership today.  I hope to continue the legacy of faith, hope, love and courage started by the Infant Jesus Sisters and the school leaders that have come before me.</p>

<p>I invite you to journey with us as we continue this mission to educate young women who are confident in who they are, rooted in faith, and ready to serve the world with courage, compassion and hope.</p>
<br>Blessings,
<br>Ms Genevieve Chye
<br>Principal
