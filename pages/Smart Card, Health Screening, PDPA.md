<h4><strong>SCHOOL SMART CARDS</strong></h4>
<p>Please note that all students entering Secondary 1 in Jan 2025 will be
issued a new Secondary level School Smart Cards (SSC). We will update you
on the collection of the card once the school is informed of the delivery
dates.</p>
<p>While you wait for your Secondary level SSC to be ready, you can continue
to use your Primary level SSCs for concessionary travel until you receive
your new card. You can still purchase the Bus Concession Pass (BCP) using
your Primary level SSCs but you will need to purchase the BCP for Secondary
School students.</p>
<h4><strong>ANNUAL HEALTH SCREENING, IMMUNISATION AND DENTAL SERVICES</strong></h4>
<p>The Health Promotion Board (HBP) provides annual health screening, immunisation
and dental services for your child. These services ensure the protection
of your child’s health and early detection of health issues. Your consent
is needed to ensure your child receives these important health and dental
services provided. Please refer to a separate PG in late Dec or early 2025
with instructions for consent.</p>
<h4><strong>PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION ACT (PDPA)</strong></h4>
<p>A PDPA consent letter will also be sent separately via PG for your approval,
allowing us to use your daughter’s photographs in various school publications
and on our social media accounts.</p>
<p>Once again, we would like to welcome you to CHIJ Secondary and look forward
to meeting your daughter/ward on the first day of school!</p>
