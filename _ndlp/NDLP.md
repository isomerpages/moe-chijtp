# National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)
![](/images/p1png.png)

At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy.   

  

The Covid-19 pandemic has revealed the need for us to accelerate the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP). All secondary schools will thus embark on the Personalized Digital Learning Programme (PDLP).

  

**PDLP Outcomes @ CHIJ**  

  

With every student owing a PLD, teachers can leverage the affordances of ICT tools to create ICT-enriched learning experiences. 

Through the PDLP, CHIJ aims to develop students into 

i) Critical Thinkers

ii) Leaders of Self and Others

iii) Effective Communicators.
