**National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)**

At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy.   

  

The Covid-19 pandemic has revealed the need for us to accelerate the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP). All secondary schools will thus embark on the Personalized Digital Learning Programme (PDLP).

**PDLP Outcomes @ CHIJ**  
With every student owing a PLD, teachers can leverage the affordances of ICT tools to create ICT-enriched learning experiences. 

Through the PDLP, CHIJ aims to develop students into 
i) Critical Thinkers
ii) Leaders of Self and Others
iii) Effective Communicators.

**Personal Learning Device @CHIJ**
Having heard the views of staff, parents, and students through various engagement sessions, the school has decided to adopt the iPad as the personal learning device for our students. Every iPad will come bundled with a Pencil to maximize its use as a learning tool. The devices will be distributed to students in Term 3, and we will progressively roll out their use during lessons.

With hardware and software in the hand of students, the work they need to do become the work they love to do. Students love iPad because it’s portable, capable, and easy to use. It helps them to become self-directed and collaborative learners with a Multi-Touch experience that’s interactive and engaging.
