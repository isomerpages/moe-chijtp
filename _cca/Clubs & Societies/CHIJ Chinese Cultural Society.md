<p>CHIJ CHINESE CULTURE SOCIETY engages itself enthusiastically in Chinese
culture largely through activities such as Chinese dance, Chinese Drama,
Chinese Wushu, Chinese calligraphy, Chinese culinary arts etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students will also gradually gain more confidence in their knowledge and
skills and serve as ambassadors of Chinese culture in CHIJ, where they
have the opportunity to helm activities, such as during Chinese New Year,
the Mid-Autumn Festival, etc.</p>
<p>In the biennial Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation for Chinese
Drama, CHIJ CHINESE CULTURE SOCIETY successfully obtained a Gold with Honours
in the year 2011 and obtained a Certificate of Distinction in 2013 and
2017, and obtained Accomplishment in 2019. In 2021 and 2023 SYF Arts Presentation
for Chinese Dance, we achieved the Certificate of Accomplishment.</p>
<p>The CHIJ CHINESE CULTURE SOCIETY experience provides an avenue in which
the girls learn the true meaning of ‘perseverance’, one of five important
school values, which help shape a Woman of Distinction.</p>
