<p><strong>Debating and Oratory Society</strong>
</p>
<p>The <strong>CHIJ Debating and Oratory Society</strong> is an active society
that participates in numerous competitions annually. While our society
is invited to several competitions every year, we participate in the ones
that offer our debaters a good platform to engage at the highest level
of debating as well as receive poignant feedback and adjudication so that
they may develop and learn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With online competitions being a common occurrence since 2020, we have
taken part in more international competitions which offer rich learning
to our debaters, giving them opportunities to hone their craft as well
as engage with students from different parts of the world. Alongside a
rigorous and intensive curriculum, every girl in the society is given the
opportunity to sharpen their intellect and critically assess events that
shape the world we live in. Each debater is expected to devote time outside
of CCA sessions to engage in discussions with her team on motions for training
and competitions as well as craft original speeches.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through the development of oratorical skills, students learn to stand
and deliver their arguments with confidence and finesse in person as well
as via video-conferencing platforms.</p>
