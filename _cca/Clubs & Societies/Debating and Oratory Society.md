<p>The CHIJ Debating and Oratorical Society is an active society that participates
in numerous competitions annually. While our society are invited to several
competitions every year, we do our best to participate in the ones that
offer our debaters a good platform to engage at the highest level of debating
as well as receive a poignant feedback and adjudication so that they may
develop and learn.</p>
<p>With online competition being a common occurrence since 2020, we have
taken part in more international competitions which offer rich learning
to our debaters, giving them opportunities to hone their craft as well
as engage with students from different parts of the world. Alongside a
rigorous and intensive curriculum, every girl in the society is given the
opportunity to sharpen their intellect and critically assess events that
shape the world we live in. Each debater is expected to devote time outside
of CCA sessions to engage in discussions with her team on motions for training
and competitions as well as craft original speeches.</p>
<p>Through the development of oratorical skills, students learn to stand
and deliver their arguments with confidence and finesse in person as well
as via video-conferencing platforms.</p>
