The CHIJ Debating and Oratorical Society is an active society that participates in numerous competitions annually. While our society are invited to several competitions every year, we do our best to participate in the ones that offer our debaters a good platform to engage at the highest level of debating as well as receive a poignant feedback and adjudication so that they may develop and learn. 

With online competition being a common occurrence since 2020, we have taken part in more international competitions which offer rich learning to our debaters, giving them opportunities to hone their craft as well as engage with students from different parts of the world. Alongside a rigorous and intensive curriculum, every girl in the society is given the opportunity to sharpen their intellect and critically assess events that shape the world we live in. Each debater is expected to devote time outside of CCA sessions to engage in discussions with her team on motions for training and competitions as well as craft original speeches. 

  

Through the development of oratorical skills, students learn to stand and deliver their arguments with confidence and finesse in person as well as via video-conferencing platforms.
