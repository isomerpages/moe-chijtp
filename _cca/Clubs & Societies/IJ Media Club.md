<p>IJ Media Club provides the opportunity for students to be involved in
photography, videography, as well as the setting up and operating of audio-visual
systems to support school-wide events and activities. Members will have
the opportunity to learn 1) basic functions and use of DSLR cameras, 2)
techniques for mobile phone photography and videography, and 3) post-production
skills through editing tools such as Snapseed and Capcut. Hands-on learning
opportunities will also be provided for members with outdoor field shoots
organised whenever possible.</p>
