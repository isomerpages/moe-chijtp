IJ Youth Mission provides an enabling environment for girls to recognize and promote the dignity of human persons especially the disadvantaged. IJ Youth Mission is transformed by the experience of servant leadership. The objectives of the CCA are to develop the social, cognitive, emotional, physical and spiritual well-being of youths.

All IJ Youth Mission members in the school are given a chance to work together with four other IJ Schools, CHIJ St. Nicholas, CHIJ St. Teresa's, CHIJ St Joseph's and CHIJ Katong. The bond that this CCA shares, is the IJ msion and vision that belongs to all the IJ schools.

  

All members participate in the annual IJ Youth Msion Inter-school Competition to showcase their community service and programme for the year. The IJ Youth Msion (CHIJ Secondary) has attained the Certificate of Distinction from 2014 to 2019 and 2022 (No competitions from 2020 and 2021 due to Covid restrictions).

  

During the year, a wide range of activities are conducted for members: Community Service, Reflection on Talks/Videos, Fundraising for the Needy, Home Visits, Camps and Development of Personal Skills through craft works and other activities.Â 

Join the IJ Youth Mission to acquire inner strength and character as well as to discover the meaning and purpose of serving the community.
