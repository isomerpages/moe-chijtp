<p><strong>IJ Youth Mission</strong> provides an enabling environment for
girls to recognize and promote the dignity of human persons, especially
the disadvantaged<strong>. IJ Youth Mission</strong> is transformed by the
experience of servant leadership. The objectives of the CCA are to develop
the social, cognitive, emotional, physical and spiritual well-being of
youths.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>All <strong>IJ Youth Mission</strong> members in the school are given opportunities
to work together with four other IJ Schools, CHIJ St. Nicholas, CHIJ St.
Teresa's, CHIJ St Joseph's and CHIJ Katong. The bond that this CCA shares
is the IJ mission that belongs to all the IJ schools.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>All members participate in the annual IJ Youth Mission Inter-school Competition
to showcase their community service and programme for the year. The IJ
Youth Mission (CHIJ Secondary) has attained the Certificate of Distinction
from 2014 to 2019, 2022 and a Certificate of Accomplishment from 2023 to

<p>During the year, a wide range of activities are conducted for members:
Community Service, Reflection on Talk or Videos, Fundraising for the Needy,
Home Visits, Camps and Development of Personal Skills through craft works
and other activities.</p>
<p>Join the <strong>IJ Youth Mission</strong> to acquire inner strength and
character as well as to discover the meaning and purpose of serving the
community.</p>
