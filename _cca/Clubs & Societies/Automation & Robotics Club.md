<p>Automation and Robotics Club (ARC) provides opportunities for students
to pursue their passion in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering &amp;
Mathematics) and make a difference to the world they live in. Technology
has imbibed every part of our lives and the next big trend is Robotics
and Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions to automate robots to perform
varied tasks.</p>
<p>At ARC, we have incorporated Design Thinking into our CCA - designing
meaningful day-to-day solutions for others through the use of robotics.
Through this process, students&nbsp;will develop competencies in building
and programming robots, as well as programming and piloting drones. Students
also learn software programming which allows them to design online games
and many other exciting outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of all that, students are trained to have a growth mindset anchored
by values such as entrepreneurial dare, grit and teamwork. We have managed
to clinch several awards over the past few years at various competitions.</p>
