<p>Pioneering in 2022, iGrow@IJ is a new CCA at IJ which aims to bring awareness
of the need to nurture sustainability practices among students as inhabitants
of our planet. Through various activities and workshops, students will
foster an understanding of how to champion environmental causes and thereafter
become stewards among their peers, influencing them to do the same.</p>

<p>iGrow@IJ offers a wide range of hands-on activities for students to participate
in, such as mending designated plots of the school garden and subsequently
a hydroponics farm, learning how to manage composting processes as well
as other upcycling and advocacy or outreach activities which members will
participate in and subsequently lead within the school. Members of this
club will also have opportunities to explore the biodiversity in and around
the school and conduct regular data collection, playing a part in contributing
to a larger pool of information about urban biodiversity in Singapore.</p>
