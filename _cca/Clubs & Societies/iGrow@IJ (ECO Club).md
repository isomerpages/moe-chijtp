<p>Started in 2022, iGrow@IJ is a CCA at IJ which aims to bring awareness
of the need to nurture sustainability practices among students as inhabitants
of our planet. Through various activities, projects and workshops, students
will foster an understanding of how to champion environmental causes and
thereafter become stewards among their peers, inspiring them to do the
same.</p>
<p>iGrow@IJ offers a wide range of hands-on activities for students to participate
in, such as mending designated plots of the school garden, cooking with
herbs grown in school and participating in workshops and learning journeys
to deepen their understanding of sustainability practices as well as planning
and organising outreach activities in school. Through our partnership with
Nature Society Singapore, members of this club will also have the opportunity
to explore the biodiversity within the school campus through regular participation
in citizen science surveys, contributing to invaluable information gathered
about the presence of urban biodiversity in Singapore.</p>
<p>iGrow@IJ welcomes all students with a passion and interest for environmental
stewardship and provides an opportunity for students to deepen their own
knowledge, understanding and appreciation for the natural world and its
importance in our lives.&nbsp;</p>
