<p>The <strong>Legion of Mary</strong> is a lay Catholic organisation present
in about 170 countries whose members serve the Church and their neighbours
on a voluntary basis. The objective of the Legion of Mary is to glorify
God through the holiness of its members developed by prayer and active
cooperation in Mary’s and the Church’s work.</p>

<p>At CHIJ Secondary, we have one Legion praesidium: Our Lady of Graces Junior
Praesidium. Every meeting includes the Rosary, spiritual reading and sharing.
Legionaries cultivate their spiritual growth through these weekly prayer
meetings and regular contact work in the form of outreach. They also assist
at school Masses and conduct the daily Chapel Morning Prayer. The Praesidium
also participates in monthly Curia meetings and fellowship programmes with
Junior Praesidia of other Catholic schools in Singapore.</p>
