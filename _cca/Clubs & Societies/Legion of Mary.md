to the Church on a voluntary basis in almost every country.&nbsp; The objective

<p>CHIJ Legion of Mary is named Our Lady of Graces Junior Praesidium. The
members begin meetings with Opening Prayers and the Rosary. Every session
include components such as spiritual readings and sharing. Legionaries
cultivate the spiritual aspect of their being through weekly prayer meetings,
regular contact work in the form of outreach. They also assist in all the
School Masses and conduct the Daily Chapel Morning Prayer. The Praesidium
also participates in the Monthly Curia Meetings, the Acies, and Fellowship
Programmes with Praesidiums of other Catholic Schools in Singapore.</p>
