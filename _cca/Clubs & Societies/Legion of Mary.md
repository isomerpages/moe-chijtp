The Legion of Mary was founded in Dublin, Ireland, on 7 September 1921, by Frank Duff. It is a lay Catholic organisation whose members give service to the Church on a voluntary basis in almost every country.  The objective of the Legion of Mary is to glorify God through the holiness of its members developed by prayer and active co-operation in Mary’s and the Church’s work.

  

CHIJ Legion of Mary is named Our Lady of Graces Junior Praesidium. The members begin meetings with Opening Prayers and the Rosary. Every session include components such as spiritual readings and sharing. Legionaries cultivate the spiritual aspect of their being through weekly prayer meetings, regular contact work in the form of outreach. They also assist in all the School Masses and conduct the Daily Chapel Morning Prayer. The Praesidium also participates in the Monthly Curia Meetings, the Acies, and Fellowship Programmes with Praesidiums of other Catholic Schools in Singapore.

  

The CHIJ Legion of Mary members organise their own annual camp, community services, and visiting of churches on Maundy Thursday.

  

The Legion of Mary invites students who are interested in praying together and serving the school in its various spiritual activities Join the Legion of Mary to have an enriched spiritual and prayer life and discover what God has in store for you!
