<p>Arts Alive! provides its member's opportunities to engage in the arts,
through a range of platforms and group activities where they learn skills
like creativity, self-expression, discipline, perseverance, risk-taking,
open-mindedness and collaboration.</p>
<p>Students at Arts Alive! get to express, explore and evaluate different
art forms while applying various materials and mediums. There would be
art exhibitions and performances to offer them a window to the vibrant
arts scene in Singapore, and to raise their cultural and aesthetic awareness.
Beyond school, they interact with different community groups through the
CCA VIA (Values-in Action) to share their knowledge and love for the arts.</p>
