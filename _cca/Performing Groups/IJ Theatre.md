**IJ Theatre** trains its members in the multi-faceted aspects of theatre production. Our students are exposed to an array of aspects from acting to stage managing, costume making, lighting, sound and props production. We believe that a theatre production is a playground for learning, where passionate members build their knowledge of theatre and performance and grow their love for the craft.

  

We believe that there's a performer in all of us. A burning passion to express ourselves beyond the confinement of the common every day. IJ Theatre embodies a creative space which pushes students to discover and rediscover their true inner strides. Our most recent public productions include 'The Silly Little Girl and The Funny Old Tree' (SYF Accomplishment, 2021), 'Cats, lost and found' (SYF Accomplishment, 2021), 'Jack and Jill' (SYF Distinction, 2019), 'Red Hill' (2016) and 'Fished"(2015).
