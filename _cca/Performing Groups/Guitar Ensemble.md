CHIJ Guitar Ensemble comprises of two ensembles - the Main Ensemble made up of the Secondary 2s to 5s, and the Junior Ensemble made up of the Secondary 1s. The Guitar Ensemble is led by Ms Karen Sin and her team of dedicated instructors.&nbsp;

  

The ensemble takes part in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (formerly known as Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging) for Instrumental Ensemble and we achieved Certificates of Distinction for the last two SYFs in 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2021.

  

Besides participating in competitions, the ensemble also performs at guitar concerts biennially.&nbsp; In 2012 and 2014, we partnered our sister school CHIJ St. Joseph’s Convent for the “Une Famille” concert. In 2016 and 2018 we combined with our very own Dance Ensemble and Choir to present an evening of dance and music.

  

2022 will see the ensemble busy preparing for "Une Famille" concert. The members are already in the midst of practicing for this much anticipated event which we have missed in 2020.&nbsp;

  

All girls are welcome to join the Guitar Ensemble, as having a music background is not a pre-requisite. If you already play a musical instrument like the piano or violin, come join us and enrich your music experience through playing the guitar or even the double bass! Our instructors will teach all new members good guitar playing techniques. All members will be given the opportunity to play together as a Junior Ensemble in school concerts.

  

The Guitar Ensemble aims to develop creativity through music when performing in concerts and during competitions. If you are a committed individual who enjoys music and would like to experience performing on stage, join us in bringing beautiful music to comfort the souls of all people.
