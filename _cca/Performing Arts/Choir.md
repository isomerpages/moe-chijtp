<p>The award-winning CHIJ Choir is well known for its high standards both
locally and abroad.</p>
<p>As an established Performing Arts group, the CCA continues to nurture
confident choir members who are passionate in taking choral music into
top-notch international competitions abroad. Choir girls have participated
in festivals and competitions in Sydney Australia, Hawaii USA, Xiamen China,
Riva del Garda Italy (twice), Olomouc Czech Republic, Wales, Hong Kong
(4 times), and Taiwan for international festivals and returned with top
awards in all categories, in all countries. We have also obtained Golds,
Gold with Honours Awards and Certificates of Distinction in all Singapore
Youth Festivals since 1997 to 2023, with excellent SYF appraisals during
Covid-19 years.</p>

<p>Choir members are disciplined, anchored in choral music and contribute
substantially to school events and in-house performances. This CCA provides
our graduating cohorts a solid platform for Direct School Admission to
preferred Junior Colleges of choice, on account of all-round high attainment
levels and distinctions every year. Within convent grounds, the girls lead
the school congregation in morning hymn and assembly, and on occasion,
are in attendance to assist school masses. In 2024 we took the lead in
the Convent’s 170th grand anniversary celebrations, participated in the
Papal Mass, and returned from the Malaysian Choral Eisteddfod International
Choir Festival 2024 with 3 Gold Medals, earning TOP 10 position in the
Grand Prix, and clinched the Championship in the Children’s Category.</p>
<p>Choir girls give of their best at every local and international competition.</p>
