<p>The award-winning <strong>CHIJ Choir</strong> is well known for its high
standards both locally and abroad.</p>
<p>As an established Performing Arts group, the CCA continues to nurture
confident choir members who are passionate in taking choral music into
top-notch international competitions abroad. Choir girls have participated
in festivals and competitions in Sydney Australia, Hawaii USA, Xiamen China,
Riva del Garda Italy (twice), Olomouc Czech Republic, Wales, Hong Kong
(4 times), and Taiwan, and Malaysia, for international festivals and returned
with top awards in all categories, in all countries. We have also obtained
Golds, Gold with Honours Awards and Certificates of Distinction in all
Singapore Youth Festivals from 1997 to 2025, with excellent SYF appraisals
during Covid-19 years.

<p>Choir members are disciplined, anchored in choral music and contribute
substantially to school events and in-house performances. This CCA provides
our graduating cohorts a solid platform for Direct School Admission to
preferred Junior Colleges of choice, on account of all-round high attainment
levels and distinctions every year. Within convent grounds, the girls lead
the school congregation in morning hymn and assembly, and on occasion,
are in attendance to assist school masses. In 2024 we took the lead in
the Convent’s 170th grand anniversary celebrations, participated in the
Papal Mass, and returned from the Malaysian Choral Eisteddfod International
Choir Festival 2024 with 3 Gold Medals, earning TOP 10 position in the
Grand Prix, and clinched the Championship in the Children’s Category.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choir girls give of their best at every local and international competition.</p>
