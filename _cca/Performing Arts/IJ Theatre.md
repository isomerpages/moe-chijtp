<p>IJ Theatre trains its members in the multi-faceted aspects of theatre
production. Our students are exposed to an array of theatre disciplines
from acting to stage managing and from costume making to lighting design.
We believe that a theatre production is a playground for learning, where
passionate members build their knowledge of theatre and performance and
grow their love for the craft.</p>

<p>There's a performer in all of us, a burning passion to express ourselves
beyond the confinement of the common every day. IJ Theatre embodies a creative
space which pushes students to discover and rediscover their true inner
strides.</p>
