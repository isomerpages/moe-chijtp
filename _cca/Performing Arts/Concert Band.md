<p>The Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) Concert Band has distinguished
itself as one of the most promising Secondary School Bands in Singapore
and has staged numerous well-received performances. An established performing
arts group in CHIJ Secondary, the Band was awarded the Certificate of Distinction
at the 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2023 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation
for Concert Bands.</p>

<p>&nbsp;In 2014, 2016 and 2018, the Band was given the opportunity to perform
at the Esplanade Concert Hall as part of the ‘Limelight’ series. In November
2018, the Band had the privilege of being invited to perform at the Istana
for Her Excellency, President Halimah Yacob as part of the Deepavali Open
House celebrations. Apart from performing outside of the school, the Band
also plays an integral role in the aesthetics and cultural life within
the CHIJ Secondary, with over a hundred girls participating in the band
programme. In April 2024, the Band will once again be performing at The
Esplanade Concert Hall for ‘Limelight’.</p>
<p>The Band hopes to inculcate discipline, perseverance and GRIT in our students
as they pursue their passion for music. One of the Band's many aims is
to help our students achieve their potential while maintaining the high
standards of music. We have graduates who have done the Band proud by excelling
in both their instrument as well as their academics, thus developing into
well-rounded young women who are both smart and cultured.</p>
<p>In line with the school's motto ‘Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty’,
the band values commitment, diligence and continuous hard work above musical
talent in its never-ending pursuit for musical excellence.</p>

<p><em>"One heart, One mind, One band, One sound".</em>
