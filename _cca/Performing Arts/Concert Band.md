The Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) Concert Band has distinguished herself as one of the most promising Secondary School Bands in Singapore. Led by well-known conductor, Mr. Adrian Chiang, the Band was awarded the Certificate of Distinction at the 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2021 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation for Concert Bands.&nbsp;

  

In 2014, 2016 and 2018, the Band was given the opportunity to perform at the Esplanade Concert Hall as part of the 'Limelight" series. In November 2018, the Band had the privilege of being invited to perform at the Istana for Her Excellency, President Halimah Yacob as part of the Deepavali Open House celebrations. Apart from performing outside the school, the Band also plays an integral role in the aesthetics and cultural life within CHIJ Secondary, with over a hundred girls participating in the band programme.&nbsp;

  

The Band hopes to inculcate discipline, perseverance and GRIT in our students as they pursue their passion for music. One of the Band's many aims is to help our students achieve their potential while maintaining the high standards of music. We have graduates who have done the Band proud by excelling in both their instrument as well as their academics, thus developing into well-rounded young women who are both smart and cultured.&nbsp;

  

In line with the school’s motto ‘Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty’, the Band believes in the value of diligence and hard work in her continual quest for musical excellence.
