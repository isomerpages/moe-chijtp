<p>Besides participating in competitions, the Ensemble also performs at guitar
concerts biennially.&nbsp; In 2012 and 2014, we partnered with our sister
school CHIJ St. Joseph’s Convent for the “<em>Une Famille</em>” concert.
In 2016 and 2018 we collaborated with our very own Dance Ensemble and Choir
to present an evening of dance and music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2022 saw the Guitar Ensemble doing a video production of the “<em>Une Famille</em>”
concert with the Concert Band, Choir and Dance Ensemble. The final production
was showcased during the school assembly.</p>
