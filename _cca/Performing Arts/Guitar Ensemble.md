<p><strong>CHIJ Guitar Ensemble</strong> is an established ensemble that adopts
the Niibori guitar system which exposes students to greater flexibility
in music making. The Main Ensemble comprises the Secondary 2s to 5s, and
the Junior Ensemble comprises the Secondary 1s.</p>
<p>Under the baton of Mr Alvin Choong and his team of dedicated instructors,
CHIJ Guitar Ensemble clinched Certificates of Distinction in the Singapore
Youth Festival Arts Presentation for Instrumental Ensemble in 2015, 2017,
2019, 2021, 2023 and 2025.</p>

<p>Besides participating in competitions, the Ensemble also performs at guitar
concerts biennially.&nbsp; In 2012 and 2014, we partnered with our sister
school CHIJ St. Joseph’s Convent for the “<em>Une Famille</em>” concert.
In 2016, 2018 and 2024 we collaborated with our very own Dance Ensemble
and Choir to present an afternoon of dance and music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2022 the Ensemble did a video production of the “<em>Une Famille</em>”
concert with the Concert Band, Choir and Dance Ensemble. The final production
was showcased during the school assembly.</p>

<p>All girls are welcome to join the Guitar Ensemble, as having a music background
is not a prerequisite. If you play a musical instrument like the piano
or violin, come join us and enrich your music experience through playing
the guitar. Our instructors aim to develop creativity and musical expression,
performing soothing and beautiful melodies for all. All new members will
be given the opportunity to perform together as a Junior Ensemble in school
concerts.</p>
<p>If you are a committed individual who enjoys music, join us in bringing
beautiful melodies to comfort the souls of all people.&nbsp;
