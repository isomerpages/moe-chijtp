**CHIJ Guitar Ensemble** is an established ensemble that adopts the Niibori guitar system which exposes students to greater flexibility in music making. The Main Ensemble comprises of the Secondary 2s to 5s, and the Junior Ensemble comprises of the Secondary 1s.

Under the baton of Mr Frankie Shi and his team of dedicated instructors, CHIJ Guitar Ensemble clinched Certificates of Distinction in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation for Instrumental Ensemble in 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2023.

Besides participating in competitions, the Ensemble also performs at guitar concerts biennially.&nbsp; In 2012 and 2014, we partnered with our sister school CHIJ St. Joseph’s Convent for the “*Une Famille*” concert. In 2016 and 2018 we collaborated with our very own Dance Ensemble and Choir to present an evening of dance and music.&nbsp;

2022 saw the Guitar Ensemble doing a video production of the “*Une Famille*” concert with the Concert Band, Choir and Dance Ensemble. The final production was showcased during the school assembly.

All girls are welcome to join the Guitar Ensemble, as having a music background is not a prerequisite. If you play a musical instrument like the piano or violin, come join us and enrich your music experience through playing the guitar. Our instructors aims to develop creativity and musical expression, performing soothing and beautiful melodies for all. All new members will be given the opportunity to perform together as a Junior Ensemble in school concerts.

If you are a committed individual who enjoys music, join us in bringing beautiful melodies to comfort the souls of all people.
