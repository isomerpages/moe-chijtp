<p>CHIJ Guitar Ensemble is an established ensemble that adopts the Niibori
guitar system which exposes students to greater flexibility in music making.
The Main Ensemble comprises of the Secondary 2s to 5s, and the Junior Ensemble
comprises of the Secondary 1s.</p>
<p>Under the baton of Mr Frankie Shi and his team of dedicated instructors,
CHIJ Guitar Ensemble clinched Certificates of Distinction in the Singapore
Youth Festival Arts Presentation for Instrumental Ensemble in 2015, 2017,
2019, 2021 and 2023.</p>
<p>Besides participating in competitions, the Ensemble also performs at guitar
concerts biennially.&nbsp; In 2012 and 2014, we partnered with our sister
school CHIJ St. Joseph’s Convent for the “<em>Une Famille</em>” concert.
In 2016 and 2018 we collaborated with our very own Dance Ensemble and Choir
to present an evening of dance and music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2022 saw the Guitar Ensemble doing a video production of the “<em>Une Famille</em>”
concert with the Concert Band, Choir and Dance Ensemble. The final production
was showcased during the school assembly.</p>
<p>All girls are welcome to join the Guitar Ensemble, as having a music background
is not a prerequisite. If you play a musical instrument like the piano
or violin, come join us and enrich your music experience through playing
the guitar. Our instructors aims to develop creativity and musical expression,
performing soothing and beautiful melodies for all. All new members will
be given the opportunity to perform together as a Junior Ensemble in school
concerts.</p>
<p>If you are a committed individual who enjoys music, join us in bringing
beautiful melodies to comfort the souls of all people.</p>
