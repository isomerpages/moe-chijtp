<p>In 2017 and 2019, IJDE was awarded a Certificate of Distinction at the
SYF Arts Presentation for Dance in the International category for its Japanese-inspired
piece, Pastoral Charm and The Simplest of Joys respectively. In 2019, the
piece was also showcased at the Momentum Dance Festival 2019 organised
by Republic Polytechnic, and Phenomenon TWO held at library@esplanade.</p>
<p>In 2018, IJDE participated in the CHIJ Secondary Art and Dance Twinning
and Cultural Programme in Fukuoka, Japan. Dancers attended dance workshops
that broadened their knowledge of Japanese culture and dance forms, and
shared their experience with peers through a dance presentation.</p>

<p>In 2021 and 2023, IJDE once again achieved Distinction for their SYF performances.
The 2023 item, A Hymn to Spring, was a portrayal of the spirit of spring,
invoking the light and refreshing quality of a spring breeze.</p>
