<p>IJ Dance Ensemble (IJDE) is a versatile dance group whose signature style
is contemporary with a strong Asian flavour. Our dancers are highly disciplined
and committed to the art form with all dancers going through a rigorous
training programme with strong emphasis on technique. Held to high standards,
dancers audition for a chance to perform for most performances. Besides
actively participating in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts
Presentation for Dance, IJDE has also been invited to perform at the Asian
Youth Games (2009), Youth Olympics Games (2010) and National Day Parade
(2012).</p>
<p>In 2017 and 2019, IJDE was awarded a Certificate of Distinction at the
SYF Arts Presentation for Dance in the International category for its Japanese-inspired
piece, Pastoral Charm and The Simplest of Joys respectively. In 2019, the
piece was also showcased at the Momentum Dance Festival 2019 organised
by Republic Polytechnic, and Phenomenon TWO held at library@esplanade.</p>
<p>In 2018, IJDE participated in the CHIJ Secondary Art and Dance Twinning
and Cultural Programme in Fukuoka, Japan. Dancers attended dance workshops
that broadened their knowledge of Japanese culture and dance forms, and
shared their experience with peers through a dance presentation.</p>
<p>In 2021 and 2023, IJDE once again achieved Distinction for their SYF performances.
The 2023 item, A Hymn to Spring, was a portrayal of the spirit of spring,
invoking the light and refreshing quality of a spring breeze.</p>
