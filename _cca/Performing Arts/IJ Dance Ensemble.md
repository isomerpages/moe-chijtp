<p>IJ Dance Ensemble (IJDE) is a versatile dance group whose signature style
is contemporary with a strong Asian flavour. Our dancers are highly disciplined
and committed to the art form. All dancers go through a rigorous training
programme with strong emphasis on technique. Held to high standards, dancers
audition for a chance to perform for most performances. Besides actively
participating in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation
for Dance, IJDE has also been invited to perform at the Asian Youth Games
(2009), Youth Olympics Games (2010) and National Day Parade (2012).</p>

<p>In 2017 and 2019, IJDE was awarded a Certificate of Distinction at the
SYF Arts Presentation for Dance in the International category for its Japanese-inspired
piece, Pastoral Charm and The Simplest of Joys respectively. In 2019, the
piece was also showcased at the Momentum Dance Festival 2019 organised
by Republic Polytechnic, and Phenomenon TWO held at library@esplanade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2018, IJDE participated in the CHIJ Secondary Art and Dance Twinning
and Cultural Programme in Fukuoka, Japan. Dancers attended dance workshops
that broadened their knowledge of Japanese culture and dance forms, and
shared their experience with peers through a dance presentation.</p>
<p>In 2023 and 2025, IJDE once again achieved Distinction for their SYF performances.
The 2025 item, Joyful Rhythm of Life, was an energetic and cheerful piece
that exuded girlish charm with grace and flair.</p>
