<p>In CHIJ Red Cross Youth, we aim to build a community of young leaders
who are achievers, socially responsible and who embrace humanitarian values.
The activities will encourage members to acquire lifesaving skills and
habits, be socially responsible citizens and also instill a sense of global
citizenship. CHIJ Red Cross Youth will thus be an avenue for members to
make a difference through their activities, in helping to save lives at
home and in the community.</p>
