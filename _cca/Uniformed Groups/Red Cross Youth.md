In CHIJ Red Cross Youth, we aim to build a community of young leaders who are achievers, socially responsible and who embrace humanitarian values. The activities will encourage members to acquire lifesaving skills and habits, be socially responsible citizens and also instill a sense of global citizenship. CHIJ Red Cross Youth will thus be an avenue for members to make a difference through their activities, in helping to save lives at home and in the community.

The activities of Red Cross Youth will focus on the following:

1. First Aid Skills;

2. Blood Donation and Donor Recruiter;

3. Disaster Management;

4. Service Learning Programme;

5. Youth Leadership in Red Cross

6. In-campus First Aid duties or public duties for national and/or community events;

7. Training in Red Cross Knowledge,

8. Footdrills and Outdoor Activities;

9. Fund Raising

Apart from training activities, CHIJ Red Cross Youth also organises recreational activities like bonding games and camps, heritage trails and outings for our cadets. Members are given the opportunity to develop their organisational and leadership skills by planning for activities and camps.
