<p><strong>The Aims of Guiding</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Girl Guide unit aims to provide girls and young women with the opportunity
to grow and to lead and to empower them to develop them to their fullest
potential as responsible citizens of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Girl Guides at CHIJ</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At CHIJ 1st Coy, the Guides live up to our motto of ‘Be Prepared’. Using
the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) model and
Girl Guides 5-point programme as a guideline, activities are organised
to maximise the potential of the Guides. These include both indoor and
outdoor activities such as handicrafts, camp-craft and outdoor cooking
which not only enable the Guides to acquire new skills but also to explore
the many wonders of nature.</p>
<p>With a serving heart and mind, the Guides also render their services in
the numerous community service projects within and outside of school. Our
community service projects include raising funds for the Girl Guide Association
though Thinking Day Pennies and through the selling of Girl Guides cookies.</p>
<p>Depending on the national posture and prevailing safe-management measures,
Guides can look forward to organising and executing the annual Secondary
One orientation campfire, attending overnight camps where they will be
sleeping under tents and collaborating with Guides and Scouts from other
schools.</p>
