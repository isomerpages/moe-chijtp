<p><strong>Girl Guides: Empowering Girls to Lead and Make a Difference</strong>
</p>
<p>The Girl Guides movement inspires girls and young women to reach their
fullest potential as responsible citizens of the world. It is a Girl-Led
movement where every and any girl feels confident to lead and be empowered
to create a better world together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At CHIJ 1<sup>st</sup> Coy, our Guides embody the motto <em>“Be Prepared”</em>.
Using the Girl Guides’ 5-point programme as the guideline, the student
leaders organise innovative and non-formal educational activities that
blend learning with fun. These include a wide range of indoor and outdoor
activities, such as handicrafts, camp-craft, outdoor cooking, and overnight
camps. These activities not only help our Guides develop valuable life
skills but also foster a sense of belonging and inclusiveness within the
coy.</p>
<p>With a serving heart and mind, our Guides actively contribute to community
service and advocacy projects, both within the school and within the community.
One such project includes raising funds for the Girl Guides Association
through the annual sale of Girl Guides cookies.</p>
<p>Throughout their Guiding journey, Guides can look forward to opportunities
to take the lead in organizing and executing events like the annual Secondary
One orientation campfire and the 3D2N overnight camp, as well as collaborating
with Guides from other schools during HQ and division events.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joining Girl Guides is more than just participating in activities—it is
about growing as individuals, building lasting friendships, and making
a positive impact on the community and the world.</p>
