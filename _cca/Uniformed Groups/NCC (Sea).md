<p>In the CHIJ National Cadet Corps (NCC) (Sea), we aim to nurture a community
of Resilient, Responsible, and Relevant student leaders. Being NCC cadets,
they experience the joy of overcoming challenges through annual camps and
courses which are held at the NCC Headquarters (HQ) campus. They will be
continuously challenged to be the best that they can be, and their holistic
education and sense of belonging to both the school and NCC community are
developed through meaningful and adventurous military-related and sea activities.</p>

<p>CHIJ NCC (Sea) would be an avenue for them to not only be future-ready
citizens, ready to serve and give back to the community, but more importantly,
develop a sense of unforgettable camaraderie that they would cherish throughout
their journey in CHIJ Secondary.</p>
