In the CHIJ National Cadet Corps (NCC) (Sea), we aim to nurture a community of Resilient, Responsible, and Relevant student leaders. Being NCC cadets, they experience the joy of overcoming challenges through annual camps and courses which are held at the NCC Headquarters (HQ) campus. They will be continuously challenged to be the best that they can be, and their holistic education and sense of belonging to both the school and NCC community are developed through meaningful and adventurous military-related and sea activities. CHIJ NCC (Sea) would be an avenue for them to not only be future-ready citizens, ready to serve and give back to the community, but more importantly, develop a sense of unforgettable camaraderie that they would cherish throughout their journey in CHIJ Secondary. To serve with Pride and Dedication!
