<p>The CHIJ Tenpin Bowling Team was established in 2001 with just a handful
of members. Over the years, it has grown steadily, and today the team boasts
an enrolment of more than 50 passionate bowlers. Each year, our members
take part in major competitions such as the <strong>National Inter-School Tenpin Bowling Championships (NSG)</strong> and
the <strong>National Age Group (NAG) Competition</strong>.</p>

<p>As a team that believes in both training and playing hard, the CHIJ Tenpin
Bowling Team promises an enjoyable and rewarding experience like no other.
We strive for that perfect throw that results in a strike — one that demands
focus, skill, and an understanding of the equipment and lane conditions.
Our bowlers are trained in all these aspects to excel in the sport.</p>
<p>Beyond the lanes, we also organise various activities to strengthen team
spirit and foster camaraderie among members, making the journey both meaningful
and memorable.</p>
