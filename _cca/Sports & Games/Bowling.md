The CHIJ Tenpin Bowling team started in 2001 with a small number of members. Over the years, however, the team has grown and enrolment now stands at more than 50 members. Every year, we participate in competitions like the National Inter-School Tenpin Bowling Championships and the National Age Group Competition.

  

A team that believes in both playing and working hard, the CHIJ Tenpin Bowling Team is one that promises an enjoyable experience like no other. We train hard in our bowling to produce the perfect hit that results in a strike. To achieve a strike would require more focus, technique, technical knowledge of your equipment and the lane conditions which our bowling team will be trained in. At the same time, we organise various other activities to foster and build not only our team spirit but also the camaraderie among the team mates at the same time.
