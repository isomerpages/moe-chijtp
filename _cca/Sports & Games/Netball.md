<p>The CHIJ Netball School Team has won the ‘B’ and ’C’ Division titles many
times over the years. This is a strong tradition that we are proud to uphold
and defend. Annually, we compete in the South Zone Netball Championships
and subsequently move on to compete in the National Inter-School Netball
Championships. Competition season lasts from January to April for the ‘B’
division and July to August for the ‘C’ division. Of which, our intensive
and rigorous training begins in the months leading up to the competitions
for each division. Under the leadership and expertise of our coach Ms Kok
Mun Wai, the CHIJ Netball School Team has flourished as her dedication
and passion for the sport has contributed immensely to the netball legacy
in CHIJ. It was her guidance, with the support of the school, which led
us to claim the double championship title for both ‘B’ and ‘C’ Division
in both the South Zone Inter-school Netball Championships as well as National
Inter-school Netball Championships consecutively in both 2015 and 2016.
In 2017, we achieved championships for South Zone Inter-school Netball
Championships while achieving 1st and 2nd placing for ‘C’ division and
‘B’ division for Nationals respectively. Through the team’s perseverance
and determination to do our best, our team managed to clinch our double
championships once again, both at the 2018 Zonal and National Championships.
In 2019, we achieved champions for both divisions in the South Zone Inter-school
Netball Championships and 2nd placing for ‘C’ division at the National
Inter-school Championships. In 2022, we achieved champions for both B &amp;
C divisions in the South Zone Inter-school Netball Championships. In 2023,
we achieved champions for both B &amp; C divisions in the South Zone and
National Inter-school Netball Championships.</p>
<p>However, the CHIJ Netball School Team is not only about winning competitions.
Besides the annual championships, CHIJ Netball also plays friendly matches
with many different schools and teams. Annually, the team also organises
a team bonding retreat and beach training at Sentosa. This helps us to
learn from the other players and allows us to gain more experience on and
off the court.</p>

<p>The Netball Recreational Club is a Co-Curricular Activity that not only
allows students to learn Netball skills and tactics under the tutelage
of a full-time experienced coach, it also emphasizes the importance of
teamwork and sportsmanship. To help us achieve these aims, the club participates
in both competitive and friendly games. Each year, every level gets to
represent the school in at least one netball competition. We participate
in various age-group netball carnivals such as the Daisy Tan Netball Carnival,
T-Net Netball Carnival and Sneakers Netball Carnival. In 2021, we organised
an in-house games carnival to promote the same camaraderie and team spirit.
We will always look for opportunities to enable our members to grow holistically.</p>
