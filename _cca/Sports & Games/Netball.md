<p>The CHIJ Netball School Team has won the ‘B’ and ’C’ Division titles many
times over the years. This is a strong tradition that we are proud to uphold
and defend. Annually, we compete in the South Zone Netball Championships
and subsequently move on to compete in the National Inter-School Netball
Championships. Competition season lasts from January to April for the ‘B’
division and July to August for the ‘C’ division. Of which, our intensive
and rigorous training begins in the months leading up to the competitions
for each division.</p>

<p>Under the leadership and expertise of our coach Ms Kok Mun Wai, the CHIJ
Netball School Team has flourished as her dedication and passion for the
sport has contributed immensely to the netball legacy in CHIJ. It was her
guidance, with the support of the school, which led us to claim the double
championship title for both ‘B’ and ‘C’ Division in both the South Zone
Inter-school Netball Championships as well as National Inter-school Netball
Championships consecutively in both 2015 and 2016. In 2017, we achieved
championships for South Zone Inter-school Netball Championships while achieving
1st and 2nd placing for ‘C’ division and ‘B’ division for Nationals respectively.
Through the team’s perseverance and determination to do our best, our team
managed to clinch our double championships once again, both at the 2018
Zonal and National Championships. In 2019, we achieved champions for both
divisions in the South Zone Inter-school Netball Championships and 2nd
placing for ‘C’ division at the National Inter-school Championships. In
2022, we achieved champions for both B &amp; C divisions in the South Zone
Inter-school Netball Championships. In 2023, we achieved champions for
both B &amp; C divisions in the South Zone and National Inter-school Netball
Championships.</p>

<p>However, the CHIJ Netball School Team is not only about winning competitions.
Besides the annual championships, CHIJ Netball also plays friendly matches
with many different schools and teams. Annually, the team also organises
a team bonding retreat and beach training at Sentosa. This helps us to
learn from the other players and allows us to gain more experience on and
off the court.</p>

<p>The Netball Recreational Club is a Co-Curricular Activity that allows
students to learn Netball skills and tactics under the tutelage of a full-time
experienced coach while emphasizing the importance of teamwork and sportsmanship.
To help us achieve these aims, the club participates in both competitive
and friendly games.</p>
<p>Each year, we aim to have every level represent the school in at least
one netball competition. We have participated in various age-group netball
competitions such as the&nbsp;Daisy Tan Netball Carnival and The Kids’
Network Carnival. Our members have gained much from participating in such
competitions.</p>
<p>For the past 3 years, we have organised an in-house games carnival to
promote the same camaraderie and team spirit. We want our members to enjoy
learning the skill as well as playing as a CCA. We are always looking for
opportunities to enable our members to grow holistically.&nbsp;</p>
