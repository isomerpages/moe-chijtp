<p>The CHIJ Netball School Team has won the ‘B’ and ’C’ Division titles many
times over the years. This is a strong tradition that we are proud to uphold
and defend. Annually, we compete in the South Zone Netball Championships
(‘B’ Division) and subsequently move on to compete in the National Inter-School
Netball Championships. In the ‘C’ Division, we play in the Pool/League
A competition.</p>
<p>The competition season lasts from January to April for the ‘B’ division
and May to August for the ‘C’ division. Naturally, our intensive and rigorous
training begins in the months leading up to the competitions for each division.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the leadership and expertise of our coach Ms Kok Mun Wai, the CHIJ
Netball School Team has flourished as her dedication and passion for the
sport has contributed immensely to the netball legacy in CHIJ. It was through
her guidance, with the support of the school, which led us to claim the
double championship title for both ‘B’ and ‘C’ Division in both the South
Zone Inter-school Netball Championships as well as National Inter-school
Netball Championships consecutively in both 2015 and 2016. In 2017, we
achieved championships for South Zone Inter-school Netball Championships
while achieving 1st and 2nd placing for ‘C’ division and ‘B’ division for
Nationals respectively.&nbsp; Through the team’s perseverance and determination
to do our best, our team managed to clinch our double championships once
again, both at the 2018 Zonal and National Championships. In 2019, we achieved
champions for both divisions in the South Zone Inter-school Netball Championships
and 2nd placing for ‘C’ division at the National Inter-school Championships.
In 2022 and 2023, we achieved champions for both ‘B’ &amp; ‘C’ divisions
in the South Zone Inter-school Netball Championships.&nbsp; In 2025, we
achieved 3rd place in the ‘B’ division National Inter-School Championships
and 2nd place in the ‘C’ division League 1 competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the CHIJ Netball School Team is not only about winning competitions.
Besides the annual championships, CHIJ Netball also plays friendly matches
with many different schools and teams. Annually, the team also organises
a team bonding retreat and beach training at Sentosa. This helps us to
learn from the other players and allows us to gain more experience on and
off the court.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Netball Recreational Club</strong>&nbsp;is a Co-Curricular
Activity that not only allows students to learn Netball skills and tactics
under the tutelage of a full-time experienced coach, it also emphasises
the importance of a good learning attitude, teamwork and sportsmanship.
To help us achieve these aims, the club participates in both competitive
and friendly games. Each year, we aim to have every level represent the
school in at least one netball competition. We have participated in various
age-group netball competitions such as the&nbsp;Daisy Tan Netball Carnival
and Deloitte Pesta Sukan Netball Carnival. Our members have gained much
from participating in such competitions. For the past 4 years, we organised
an in-house games carnival to promote the same camaraderie and team spirit.
We want our members to enjoy learning the skill as well as playing as a
CCA. We are always looking for opportunities to enable our members to grow
holistically.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>JOIN THE NETBALL CLUB</strong>! Let’s make 2026 a fruitful and
meaningful year!</p>
