<p>Rhythmic Gymnastics is a sport in our school that emphasises on poise,
rhythm, flexibility, physical fitness and contemporary dance movements.
It combines elements of dance, ballet and gymnastics with the manipulation
of various apparatus. These apparatus include the ball, hoop, rope, clubs
and the ribbon. Gymnasts use these apparatus to perform beautiful and graceful
routines.</p>
<p><strong>Competition</strong>
</p>
<p>Annually, we compete in the National Inter-School Rhythmic Gymnastics
Championships in groups or as individuals. Spanning over three days, we
take part in various categories like the compulsory, optional and group
routines. We also take part actively in competitions like Singapore Open
and National Championships organized by Singapore Gymnastics (National
Sports Association for gymnastics).</p>
