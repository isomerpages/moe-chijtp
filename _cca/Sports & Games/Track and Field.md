<p>The Track and Field CCA introduces students to a range of track and field
events, from sprints and middle-distance runs to jumping and throwing disciplines.
Students have the opportunity to try out different events before they are
sorted into an area of specialisation which their training will focus primarily
on. Those who are keen on distance running will also have the opportunity
to participate in cross-country races.</p>
<p>Training is led by experienced coaches and regular team practice helps
students build confidence and strong working relationships. Our athletes
take part in various inter-school competitions each year, such as the Allcomers
Meet, National Inter-School Cross Country Championships and National Inter-School
Track and Field Championships, where they are given opportunities to challenge
themselves and gain competition experience. With such exposure, students
also develop technical skills and race awareness, beyond physical conditioning.</p>
<p>While we aim to perform well in competitions, the CCA places equal emphasis
on personal growth. Through consistent training and teamwork, students
learn discipline, resilience, responsibility, and leadership. These are
values that extend beyond sport and support our students in their future
endeavours.</p>
