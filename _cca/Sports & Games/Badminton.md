CHIJ Badminton trains hard and plays hard. Members strive to do their best in every tournament to bring pride, glory and honour to the school. Under the guidance of our very dedicated and talented coach, Mr. Stanley Chay, our players train twice or thrice a week at the CHIJ Hall of Faith or Indoor Sports Hall.

  

The team participates in the National Inter-School Badminton Championships, Wee Kim Wee Challenge Trophy and various other inter-school tournaments organized by Community Centres, Clubs or Organizations. With the local tournaments and biennial camp or overseas training trip, the players are exposed to various training styles. This exposure contributes to the success of the students in becoming a skillful player, together with the support and encouragement of the teachers and coach. So come for the School Team selections and keep the IJ Badminton spirit burning!
