<p><strong>CHIJ Badminton</strong> trains hard and plays hard. Members strive
to do their best in every tournament to bring pride, glory and honour to
the school. Under the guidance of our very dedicated coaches, Coach Bimo
Adi Prakoso &amp; Assistant coach Paulus Irwanto Hidajat, our players train
twice or thrice a week at the CHIJ Hall of Faith or Indoor Sports Hall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team participates in the National School Games Badminton Championships,
Alpha Age Group Tournament and various other inter-school tournaments organised
by Community Centres, Clubs or Organizations. With the local tournaments
and friendly matches, the players are exposed to various playing styles.
This exposure contributes to the success of the students in becoming a
skillful player, together with the support and encouragement of the teachers
and coaches. So come for the <strong>Badminton Team </strong>selections
and keep the <strong>IJ Badminton</strong> spirit burning! Join <strong>IJ Badminton</strong>!</p>
