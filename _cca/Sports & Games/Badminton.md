<p>CHIJ Badminton trains hard and plays hard. Members strive to do their
best in every tournament to bring pride, glory and honour to the school.
Under the guidance of our very dedicated and talented coach, Mr. Stanley
Chay, our players train twice or thrice a week at the CHIJ Hall of Faith
or Indoor Sports Hall.</p>
<p>The team participates in the National Inter-School Badminton Championships,
Wee Kim Wee Challenge Trophy and various other inter-school tournaments
organized by Community Centres, Clubs or Organizations. With the local
tournaments and biennial camp or overseas training trip, the players are
exposed to various training styles. This exposure contributes to the success
of the students in becoming a skillful player, together with the support
and encouragement of the teachers and coach. So come for the School Team
selections and keep the IJ Badminton spirit burning!</p>
