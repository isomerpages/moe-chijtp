<p>CHIJ Tennis has a long and illustrious history, from the time the school
was at its original site at Victoria Street where training was held in
a tennis court surrounded by the Sisters’ quarters. In Tennis, we strive
not only to nurture each Tennis girl as a fine sportswoman but also, more
importantly, to become A Woman of Distinction who espouses our IJ school
values.</p>

<p>Our coaches, with the support of the teachers in-charge, work on improving
the students’ tennis skills and fitness levels with a variety of drills
and games. The teachers and coaches believe that a holistic approach to
CCA is imperative. Although preparation for the annual National Inter School
Tennis Competition is taken very seriously, the more important core sports
values of teamwork and sportsmanship are emphasised during all training
sessions, and the players’ overall growth and development is considered
the greatest priority.</p>
