<p>CHIJ Tennis boasts a rich legacy that traces back to our school's founding
days at Victoria Street, where dedicated students first honed their skills
on a single court nestled within the Sisters' quarters. This humble beginning
has blossomed into a programme that continues to shape young athletes today.</p>
<p>At CHIJ Tennis, we pursue excellence beyond the baseline. While we develop
skilled sportswomen through rigorous training, our deeper commitment lies
in nurturing Women of Distinction who embody the timeless values of our
IJ heritage: truth, justice, freedom, and love.</p>
<p>Our experienced coaches, working closely with dedicated teacher mentors,
employ diverse training methodologies including:</p>
<p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Progressive skill development drills</p>
<p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fitness conditioning programmes</p>
<p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Strategic game play sessions</p>
<p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mental resilience building</p>
<p>We embrace a holistic approach to student development. While we prepare
rigorously for the National Inter School Tennis Competition, we prioritise
the cultivation of essential life values. Every training session emphasises
teamwork, sportsmanship, and personal growth, recognising that true victory
lies in character development.</p>
<p>Every CHIJ Tennis player leaves our programme not just as a better athlete,
but as a more confident, resilient, and values-driven individual ready
to serve both on the court and in life.</p>
